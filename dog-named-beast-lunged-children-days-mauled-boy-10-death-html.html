His friend Salter was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. Both were banned from owning a dog indefinitely. After Beast's death it was later found to be an 115lb American Bully or XL Bully, which are not on the banned breed list.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>CCTV footage shown in court revealed the animal attacked shoppers and lunged at children outside the local shop. One incident was 24 hours before Jack died, and showed the owners&nbsp;laughing.</p><h3>more videos</h3><a class=js-move-prev href=# id=ext-gen42><span></span></a><ul class=rotator-pages><li
