The clip below kind of looks like a modern-day scene out of The Dukes of Hazzard,&nbsp;but it is not. This happened in Georgia on May 24, when&nbsp;a woman drove her car into a tow truck at full speed on a highway and the crash was caught on video.</p><p>Newly released body cam footage from a Lowndes County Sheriff’s deputy shows the car go&nbsp;up high in the air and travel about 120 feet before smashing back down onto the highway. Officers were on the other side of the highway conducting a traffic stop when the crash occurred.</p><p>The driver was a 21-year-old woman, who was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.&nbsp;Georgia State Patrol deputies said the car traveled an additional 23 feet after hitting another car when it crashed back onto the highway.</p><p>For comparison purposes, here is a jump from the General Lee on&nbsp;The Dukes of Hazzard.</p><p>It’s still unclear if the driver will be facing charges. There has been no&nbsp;other information about her or her condition. But let this serve as a reminder: If you're approaching emergency vehicles, or any stopped vehicles, slow down, and be alert and give them the space they need.</p><p>Evan Paul is the host of&nbsp;<a class="x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0" title="Original URL: https://tasteofcountry.com/category/taste-of-country-nights/.
