The sitcom, which took place at the fictional Bayside High School in L.A., featured a spirited ensemble cast of charming teens, and expertly mixed lighthearted comedy with occasional explorations of more serious subjects. Well-known for its colorful sets (we still wish we could hang out at that diner!) and funky fashions (acid wash jeans and neon accessories galore!), Saved by the Bell and its cast encapsulated the styles of the time, and has inspired much nostalgia in recent years.</p><p>Saved by the Bell ran for four seasons, from 1989 to 1993. So popular was the show that it spawned two spinoffs (Saved by the Bell: The College Years and Saved by the Bell: The New Class) and two TV movies (Saved by the Bell: Hawaiian Style and Saved by the Bell: Wedding in Las Vegas).</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>It was even revived on Peacock in 2020, with many original cast members returning decades later. You can’t beat the original, though, and its hard to believe it’s been 30 years since we said goodbye to our pals at Bayside High.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/saved-by-the-bell_dbd0db-edited.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Saved by the Bell cast</h2><p>It’s been a long time since the charismatic teen cast of Saved by the Bell roamed the high school hallways. Here’s a look at what they’ve been up to lately.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mark-Paul Gosselaar as Zack Morris</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/1-4.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark-Paul Gosselaar</a> played Zack Morris, the leader of the pack at Bayside High. Gosselaar began modeling as a child, and appeared in episodes of The Wonder Years, Punky Brewster and Charles in Charge.</p><p>He then played Zack Morris in Good Morning, Miss Bliss, a short-lived Disney Channel show. That’s right, while Saved by the Bell became far better known, it’s actually a spinoff of that series, and a few of our favorite Saved by the Bell characters originated there, too!</p><p>After Saved by the Bell, Gosselaar starred in the show Hyperion Bay in 1998, but it only lasted 17 episodes. He then starred in another show, D.C., in 2000, and this one ran just seven episodes. Soon enough, Gosselaar would find success again and prove he had serious acting chops when he starred in NYPD Blue as a street-smart detective from 2001 to 2005. He then had recurring roles in Commander in Chief and starred as a defense attorney in Raising the Bar.</p><p>From 2011 to 2014, Gosselaar starred as Peter Bash in the legal dramedy Franklin & Bash. He then starred in Truth Be Told, Pitch and The Passage — all of which were cancelled after a single season. More recently, Gosselaar starred in Mixed-ish, the prequel to the popular series Black-ish.</p><p>Currently, Gosselaar, now 49, can be seen playing against type as a grotesque kidnapper who lives in the basement of his former captive on Found.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mario Lopez as A.C. Slater in the Saved by the Bell cast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/2-4.png><p>Before being cast as the popular jock A.C. Slater, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Lopez</a> was a dancer. His first role was on the series a.k.a. Pablo in 1984. From 1984 to 1986, he was a dancer on Kids Incorporated.</p><p>After Saved by the Bell the charming, dimpled star played a bike-riding beach police officer on Pacific Blue from 1998 to 2000. In 2006, he joined the cast of the soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful.</p><p>He also had recurring roles on Nip/Tuck and Nashville, and has been in movies like Depraved, Eastside, Get Him to the Greek and Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping. As a pop culture icon, in many of his movie and TV appearances Lopez has appeared as himself.</p><p>Now 50, Lopez currently hosts Access Hollywood. Before that, he hosted Extra, and he’s been on over a thousand episodes of each of these ubiquitous entertainment news shows.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dustin Diamond as Samuel “Screech” Powers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/3-4.png><p>Every school needs a resident nerd and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dustin Diamond</a> fit the bill perfectly as Screech. Diamond originated his signature character in Good Morning, Miss Bliss and starred in all the Saved by the Bell spinoffs, including Saved by the Bell: The New Class.</p><p>After Saved by the Bell, Diamond turned to stand-up comedy and reality show appearances. He also appeared in movies like Big Fat Liar, Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star and A Dog for Christmas. Like many former child stars, Diamond battled demons in his personal life, and had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a slew of scandals</a> in the ’00s.</p><p>Sadly, Diamond was diagnosed with cancer in 2021 and passed away that year at just 44 years old.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lark Voorhies as Lisa Turtle in the Saved by the Bell cast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/4-4.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lark Voorhies</a> played the rich and ultra-stylish Lisa Turtle. Like Gosselaar and Diamond, she first played her Saved by the Bell role on Good Morning, Miss Bliss.</p><p>In 1993, the year after Saved by the Bell ended, Voorhies joined the cast of the soap opera Days of Our Lives, playing a young single mom. In 1995, she was cast in another soap, The Bold and the Beautiful, where she played a fashion design intern.</p><p>Voorhies was also a regular on the sitcom In the House and showed up in episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Family Matters and The Parkers.</p><p>Now 49, Voorhies has recently been candid about her ongoing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">struggles with her mental health</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tiffani-Amber Thiessen as Kelly Kapowski</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/6-4.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiffani-Amber Thiessen</a> played the popular cheerleader Kelly Kapowski. With her bright blue eyes and big smile, its no surprise she started out as a model and beauty pageant queen. While starring on Saved by the Bell, she appeared in episodes of Charles in Charge, <a href=#>Married… With Children</a>, Step by Step and Blossom.</p><p>Once Saved by the Bell ended, Thiessen acted in a variety of ’90s TV movies and appeared in the films Son in Law, Love Stinks, The Ladies Man and Hollywood Ending. Her TV success continued, as she played the conniving vixen Valerie Malone on Beverly Hills, 90210 from 1994 to 2000.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>‘Saved by the Bell’ Actress Tiffani Thiessen Wants You To Get Gardening — And Is Showing You How</a></p><p>More recently, Thiessen, now 49, co-starred in the FBI procedural White Collar and the teen show Alexa & Katie (playing a mom this time!). Outside of acting, Thiessen has also written two <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cookbooks</a> and hosted two cooking shows, Dinner at Tiffani’s and Deliciousness.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Elizabeth Berkley as Jessie Spano</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Elizabeth-Berkley.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Berkley</a> played the studious and strong-willed Jessie Spano. The tall, curly-haired actress started out as a model and dancer, and appeared in episodes of Gimme a Break! and Silver Spoons before being cast in Saved by the Bell.</p><p>Berkley’s first big move following Saved by the Bell proved infamous: She starred in the controversial 1995 stripper drama Showgirls, shedding her good girl image (and her clothes) and getting widely ridiculed for her performance. The over-the-top style of Showgirls made it into a cult classic, but it ultimately dashed Berkley’s hopes of film stardom. Berkley has maintained a sense of humor about the role, and frequently posts Showgirls-related content on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram page</a>, much to the delight of that movie’s fans.</p><p>After Showgirls, Berkley had supporting parts in The First Wives Club, Any Given Sunday, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion and S. Darko. She also had recurring roles in The L Word and CSI: Miami.</p><p>Now 51, Berkley acted in a variety of plays in the ’00s and competed on Dancing With the Stars. Her status as a role model to teen girls inspired her to start a self-help site called “Ask Elizabeth,” which she turned into <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a book</a> in 2011.</p><p><strong>Find more classic <a href=#>90s</a> sitcoms below!</strong></p><p><a href=#>‘Wings’ TV Show Cast Then and Now: Soaring Beyond Nantucket</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Roseanne’ Cast Then and Now: A Look Back at the Stars of the Groundbreaking Comedy</a></p><p><a href=#>‘Married…with Children’ Cast Then and Now: Catch Up With The Bundy Clan</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonKeslafBorXNppynrF%2Borrexw2aZsmWknbJursSlo2abkajBbrrOsA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./video-britney-spears-celebrates-weight-loss-amid-fasting-journey-html.html><span>←</span><span>Video: Britney Spears celebrates her weight loss amid fasting journey</span></a>
