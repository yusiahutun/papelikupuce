If designed poorly, it will take away all the glory of the magnificent house design. Therefore, this <a href=#>protective section</a> of the house should look great. But how do you do it? There are numerous modern roofing styles in <a href=# rel=noopener>Kenya</a> that you can go for whenever you are building a house.</p><h3>1. Gabled roofing</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1598e5f534a99ce5.jpeg><p class=align-left>If you have a tight budget, this is the design for you, as it is one of the cheapest roofing designs in Kenya. Its ease of installation has made it the most common design many homeowners adopt. And what does it look like?</p><p class=align-left>The design is characterised by two sloping sides at the peak, forming the most significant part of the roof and creating a triangular shape. Many also love g<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">able roofs </a>because they provide sufficient space for ventilation and even allow the homeowner a chance to install a dormer. The dormer offers extra living space.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/179a71272e2b2899.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ save the date quotes for a wedding: Best, funny, and cute ideas</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The gable roof comes out perfect when the house is rectangular. A perfect example is a school classroom.</p><h3>2. Hipped roofing design</h3><p class=align-left>A hipped roof design is slightly similar to the gabled style, but all the slides slope downward towards the house's walls. All the sides of the roof meet at the peak, forming a ridge at the top. The good thing about this design is that it is durable because the four sides make it stable to withstand external forces. It is one of the most preferred bungalow roof designs in Kenya.</p><h3>3. Flat roof design</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/44a7ef7291cca9d9.jpeg><p class=align-left>A <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">flat roof </a>is something simple and doesn't require anything fancy. This futuristic design was once a preserve of commercial and industrial buildings, but it is now becoming familiar with residential constructions.</p><p class=align-left>Although the roof is referred to as flat, it is slightly slanted to allow water to flow whenever it rains. Unfortunately, a flat roof might be less durable than the pitch-shaped gable and hipped roof design. The top requires regular maintenance to ascertain it is in excellent condition.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cb11fbaa15207330.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 feminine classy thigh tattoos ideas for women in 2023</span></p></a><p class=align-left>With the flat roof design, you can use the space to create a recreational area for hosting <a href=#>family</a> events.</p><h3>4. The shed/skillion roof design</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/179a71272e2b2899.jpg><p class=align-left>The shed, also called skillion, is one of the <a href=#>best roofing styles</a> in Kenya. Creation and installation are straightforward, as the single-pitched roof slopes in one direction. There is nothing more to add to the design, and the simplicity makes your home look elegant without much effort.</p><p class=align-left>Don't even consider installing this roof if you live in an area that experiences heavy rainfall or snow, as it might provide enough protection. The top is also not recommended in windy areas as they risk being blown off.</p><h3>5. Gambrel design</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0e485d1e4f3fc4ee.jpeg><p class=align-left>Although most Kenyans wouldn’t go for a gambrel roof design, it is considered one of the best and most sophisticated roof shapes. The design, also called a barn roof, has two slopes on each side, with the lower slope being steeper than the upper section.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6fe97057967494c9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 simple bedsitter design plans in Kenya with measurements</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This roofing style is excellent for someone looking for extra space, providing extra headroom in the attic. It is a standard design for farmhouses and barns. Unfortunately, because of the roof’s complicated design, it might be expensive to construct.</p><h3>6. Mansard roof design</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cb11fbaa15207330.jpg><p class=align-left>You will hardly see this roofing design in Kenya, but a few houses have gone for it, and it looks stunning. The roofing style, also called the French roof, is a multi-sided gambrel-style hip roof with two slopes on each side. The lower slope of the roof has a steeper angle than the upper and often features dormer windows.</p><p class=align-left>The advantage of this roof is that it maximises the attic space and provides a simple way to add more storeys to a building without extra masonry work.</p><h3>7. Saltbox roof design</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/aefdc4d3816b511c.jpeg><p class=align-left>Some consider the saltbox design the best roof shape. However, its prevalence in Kenya is a little, but you will always find unique cases where builders have chosen to use this as inspiration to build a custom design.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0ab8972a8c0c9156.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best Roblox Bloxburg house ideas for your next mansion</span></p></a><p class=align-left>One thing about the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">saltbox roof</a> is that it is distinct and easily recognisable. The roof design is ideal for areas with a lot of rain. Instead of being symmetrical, the roof is much longer on one side. The long side of the roof extends to the first floor of two and three-storey homes. Something else that makes the saltbox look incredible is the chimney coming out of the middle.</p><h3>8. Butterfly roof design</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b4e1c14e6a8fb0dc.jpeg><p class=align-left>If you are looking for the best 3 bedroom roofing designs in Kenya, consider the butterfly design. The roofing style is v-shaped with two slopes that meet at a central valley mimicking butterfly wings.</p><p class=align-left>The design has been widely adopted recently and is loved by many because of its eye-catching appearance. However, butterfly roofs can be expensive to construct, unlike other simple designs.</p><h3>9. Dormer roofing</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6fe97057967494c9.jpeg><p class=align-left>A dormer roof is whereby a vertical window is attached to the roof. And this vertical roof can be of any style: hipped, gabble, shed, etc. The window brings in the perfect lighting to the attic. Another great thing about a dormer is that it is an ideal solution to increase space and provide extra room in your house without involving the mason. There's also more headroom.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/367b121a2630bb67.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best one bedroom house plans and designs to inspire you</span></p></a><h3>10. Curved roof design</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5930ef975f574c85.jpeg><p class=align-left>A curved design isn’t among the cheap roofing designs in Kenya, but you would want to consider it because of its elegance. As its name states, the unique design is characterised by its gently curved shape that adds a modern and artistic look to your house.</p><p class=align-left>Another great thing about the curved roof design is that you can use different roofing materials like metal, wood, and concrete. The roof design is suitable for residential and <a href=#>commercial buildings</a>.</p><p class=align-left>There are numerous impressive roofing designs you can go for if you are interested in making your house look great while at the same time providing that mandatory protective feature.
