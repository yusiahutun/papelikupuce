O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story </i>fully took over America — a full seven weeks preceding the moment when a juror told Judge Ito that black people loved Ross over Target. One of the only consistent negative critiques of the wildly acclaimed anthology series has been that, perhaps, someone other than Cuba Gooding Jr. could have played O.J. I happen to think he’s doing a fine job, mainly because he’s the seventh-most-important character in the show. But then a <a href=#>random tweet</a> popped up in my life, making me question the casting. The tweet suggested that Terrence Howard would have been a better Juice.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-7cc3e977581e1aa7f04f3a859d02d2a2-4-0-0@published data-word-count=68>This is not a bad opinion. He does have a gift for playing characters to which he might be eerily similar (see: all of them). It’s a fun experiment, thinking of Terrence Howard in the O.J. Simpson universe. Or, it <i>was </i>a fun experiment. Google “Terrence Howard” and “O.J. Simpson” together, and it takes you to a magical place. That place: 1995’s made-for-TV movie, <i>The O.J. Simpson Story</i>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-7cc3e977581e1aa7f04f3a859d02d2a2-5-0-0@published data-word-count=6>Here is that film, in full.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-7cc3e977581e1aa7f04f3a859d02d2a2-7-0-0@published data-word-count=2>You’re welcome.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-7cc3e977581e1aa7f04f3a859d02d2a2-8-0-0@published data-word-count=50>This film, like <i>The People v. O.J. Simpson</i>, begins with that snitch bloody-footed dog and Simpson being taken to the airport for his Chicago flight on the night of the murder.

If you aren’t familiar with this miniseries, just know that <i>The Jacksons: An American Dream </i>is like <i>Roots</i>, but better. It tells the story of the Jacksons, and, while it was filled with actors, it should be treated with the honor and respect due a documentary. In <i>An American Dream</i>, we see the Jacksons over the years, and much like in the ‘90s O.J. film, there are young and old versions of certain characters. One of those characters is Jackie Jackson, the eldest Jackson brother.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-7cc3e977581e1aa7f04f3a859d02d2a2-25-0-0@published data-word-count=15>This is the Jackson cast in their younger years, with Jackie on the far right.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/698/0f5/1c21ab10b1227f9bc79d38d306cc4a7a83-terrence5.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-7cc3e977581e1aa7f04f3a859d02d2a2-27-0-0@published data-word-count=24>Why, hello there, Bumper as Jackie Jackson.
