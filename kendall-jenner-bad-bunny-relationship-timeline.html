I am clear and my friend Jomar is clear and my mother is clear. They are the only ones to whom I have to clarify anything. As for Juliana Dominguez from Mississippi, I have nothing I need to clarify to her. Never. About anything.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He adds, “There are people who say that artists have to put up with it.

Nowadays, everybody is a paparazzo,” he says. “Everyone is taking photos, everyone is recording. Nobody respects anybody’s privacy, and not only my privacy as a celebrity, but yours. ... Because if right now you go out there and your pants are ripped and you can see a butt cheek, or a pigeon shits on you, there’s a bastard who will film you and take a picture of you.”</p><h2 data-node-id=36 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">August 28, 2023: Bunny wears Kendall’s K initial necklace.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Benito once again subtly showed his love for Jenner on his Instagram Story by wearing a dainty gold chain necklace with a K charm.

Come here!” she says. “Mami, be careful,” Bunny tells her. “Rabies?” she asks. “The mosquitoes,” he replies.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pair’s faces don’t show in the video, but the sweet back-and-forth conversation is the most we’ve gotten from them in terms of insight into their dynamic.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And in another subtle tribute to Jenner, the “Where She Goes” rapper also posts a photo on his Story of two cocktails—presumably his and Jenner’s—next to an 818 tequila bottle, which is the model’s brand.
