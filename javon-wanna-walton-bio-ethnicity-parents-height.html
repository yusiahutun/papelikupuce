He is a child boxing and gymnastics prodigy with already a state champion title under his name — while his on-screen character “Ashtray” is a teen wrapped up in the world of drugs.</span></p><p><span>Keep reading this Javon “Wanna” Walton Bio to learn more about him.</span></p><h3><b>Javon “Wanna” Walton On Euphoria</b></h3><p><span>HBO’s </span><i><span>Euphoria</span></i><span> season 2 premiered on January 9, 2022, and Javon’s character&nbsp; “Ashtray” attacked Mouse with a hammer, just in the very first episode. So, with that, any hopes of Javon finding a more productive path soon seemed like a distant dream.</span></p><p><span>But then again, sex, drugs, and violence were three things </span><i><span>Euphoria</span></i><span> was popular for.</span></p><p><span>On the show’s inaugural season, Ashtray was portrayed as a baby, abandoned by his <a href=#>gun-wielding grandmother</a>. He then grew up with Fezco, who also lost his grandmother and caretaker while he was young. So, forced to grow up quickly, the two lost track and found themselves walking the wrong path.</span></p><p><b>Did you know: </b><span>Ash even got his nickname because he would chew cigarette butts in the bathtub.</span></p><h3><b>What Is Javon “Wanna” Walton Ethnicity?</b></h3><p><span>We could just be vague and label Javon “Wanna” Walton as “White Caucasian” as many others do, or we could dig around a little about his parent’s ethnicity.
