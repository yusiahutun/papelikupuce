Thus, we can imagine that she is pretty popular even though she is not a teenager yet.</p><p>She can always be seen accompanying her dad in various events in Hollywood, and fans can’t seem to get enough of seeing her cute face.</p><p>This article sheds light on the Wiki-Biography and other details of the daughter of Paul Rudd, Darby Rudd.</p><h2>Wiki-Biography</h2><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-6631 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Darby-Rudd-father-Paul-Rudd.jpg alt="Image of Darby Rudd with her father, Paul Rudd" width=1200 height=1799 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-6631 class=wp-caption-text>Darby Rudd with her father, Paul Rudd</p><p>Darby is the youngest child of the couple. She was born in 2010 to Paul and Julie Rudd.</p><p>An American by default nationality, however, she does share some roots with the Jews as Paul’s parents came from a Jewish background. The young girl is 12 years old as of 2022 and does not have much screen time apart from joining her father in many of his events.</p><p>Paul loves his baby daughter dearly; in fact, when he starred as Ant-Man, he was pretty uncomfortable with having another on-screen daughter beside her daughter. The actor was worried if it would bother his real child.</p><p>Therefore, whenever the duo would watch the film together, Paul would always tell Darby that she is the real Cassie in the movie. It worked very well in the actor’s favor, and Darby loved every second of the film.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, she can always be seen with her father at many of his events. However, many fans know that this role was first taken by her brother Jack who is four years older than his sister and was born in 2006.</p><p>The celeb child is adorable and will be a teenager next year. Regarding her education, the Hollywood couple has revealed their daughter’s school, something that makes sense when you are a famous celebrity.</p><p>In addition to that, Darby’s name translates to ‘free from envy.’ It is inspired by the Irish North Germanic language.</p><h2>Here’s How Paul Rudd’s Daughter Looks Like Now</h2><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-6632 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Darby-Rudd.jpg alt="Image of Darby Rudd" width=1538 height=888 sizes="(max-width: 1538px) 100vw, 1538px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-6632 class=wp-caption-text>Darby Rudd is the youngest child of Paul Rudd</p><p>Little Rudd has the accent of her father on her face.
