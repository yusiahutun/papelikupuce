"You're not prepping your hair properly."</p><p id=e2v8ChmO9K data-wc=30>"Start with your hair 80 per cent wet, spray each section with Color WOW's<strong>&nbsp;'</strong><span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored nofollow">Raise the Root</a></span>', keep the styler there until it's completely dry and then pin your curls."&nbsp;</p><p id=e4mnfVErBl data-wc=26>"And follow up with hairspray?" I ask. "Sure, if you really want to," he adds, joking that I'd never be able to brush my hair again.&nbsp;</p><p id=eALAYrjAIsT data-wc=37>Sure enough, I put his theory to the test. At the time of writing, I'm on day three of a bouncy blowout that is showing no signs of dropping. Prep, pin, set is my new life motto. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/85d7e4bf734d-chris-appleton-and-jlo.jpg><p id=eDxYgnWjntb data-wc=48>In a year where the laid-back boho beauty trends of the 70s have made a major comeback, even <a class=hm-link href=#>the Princess of Wales has followed suit with a new 'do</a>, surprising royal fans earlier this year when she debuted curtain bangs and soft, bouncy waves tumbling past her shoulders.&nbsp;</p><p id=epXnYtK0dhQ data-wc=36>Settling the debate on whether <strong>Princess Kate's famous mane is enhanced with hair extensions</strong>, Chris pours over a recent photo of the royal I share on my phone, inspecting the ends of her perfectly preened hair.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/df1fc83a79de-kate-middleton-hand-injury-prison-visit.jpg><p id=eB7ZVS5urxG data-wc=58>"They're not extensions," he says with absolute certainty. "She's got great hair, she always has done. I can tell by the ends of her hair that they're not extensions. They have a softness to them and they're split in places. I think her new curtain bangs and addition of layers has made the back look longer, that's all."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fdc3b13d82f5-kate-middleton-wedding-hair.jpg><p id=ebhUi2f6Ff data-wc=27>As our conversation meanders between hair extensions and royal hair looks, Chris shares his vision for Princess Kate if she were to sit in his styling chair.</p><p id=evt4EJJXSKrD data-wc=22>Kate's trailblazing 'Demi Chignon' wedding hair broke a 350-year royal tradition of bridal updos, with cascading curls falling behind her tulle veil.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: 100 years of royal hairstyles</figure><p id=eosTK0IDFE data-wc=53>"If Kate was getting married today, I'd modernise that look with a centre parting. She has such a beautiful face I would've framed it with a softer, tailored look, maybe even with the curtain bangs down. The curls looked quite set too, I'd brush them out to give them a bit more fluidity."&nbsp;</p><p id=eOwT33f99N data-wc=47>After getting his first job in a salon at just 13, Chris went on to win Young Hairdresser of the Year at 27, kickstarting his illustrious career with some of the industry's biggest names; Kate Moss, Ariana Grande, Adele and Dua Lipa, to name just a few.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLg1S5pMh4 data-wc=22>Before we close our chat, I ask Chris if he could pinpoint a career-defining moment in his 27-year experience working with hair.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3e2519767da8-2974250161126925481981911843655607821043392n.jpg><p id=eBSRBXyl9w data-wc=60>"Moving to America," he says. "A lot changed for me when I moved seven years ago. I took a leap of faith to see if I could go to Hollywood. I'm just a guy from Leicester and didn't really believe that I could ever do that, so the fact that I've managed to is something I feel so proud of."&nbsp;</p><p id=euwtiwgPQw8 data-wc=21>And as for hair trends that Chris thinks should stay in 2023?
