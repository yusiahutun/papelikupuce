There’s also <a href=#><strong>Brooke Shields</strong></a> and <strong>Andre Agassi</strong>; <a href=#><strong>Bradley Cooper</strong></a> and <strong>Jennifer Esposito</strong>; and tons more. It’s time for you to take a trip down memory lane!</p><p>As fans know, the iconic <a href=#>ER</a> alum is living a life of wedded bliss with spouse <a href=#><strong>Amal Clooney</strong></a> nowadays. Prior to walking down the aisle with the London-based barrister in 2014, George was romantically involved with Talia, a television and film actress.</p><p>It’s easy for George and Talia’s marriage to slip your mind considering the Ocean’s Eleven actor was looked at as the eternal Hollywood bachelor for decades, having dated a long list of women before settling down with Amal. However, it’s important to note that George was married to Talia for four years.</p><p>The handsome heartthrob and the Divorce actress tied the knot in Las Vegas on December 15, 1989, but they called it quits in 1993. Looking back on the demise of their marriage, George said he wasn’t ready to fully give himself to another person.</p><p>“I probably — definitely — wasn’t someone who should have been married at the point,” he once told <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> of their split. “I just don’t feel like I gave Talia a fair shot.”</p><p>Fortunately for the two, there are no hard feelings between the Batman and Robin star and Talia. “George is charming. He remains charming. I’ve worked with him,” the Crawlspace actress gushed to <a href=#>People</a> in 2016, noting she’s “very happily married” to her second husband, <a href=#><strong>John Slattery</strong></a>.</p><p>Hollywood has seen many other couples, such as <a href=#><strong>Julia Roberts</strong></a> and <strong>Lyle Lovett</strong>; <a href=#><strong>Renée Zellweger</strong></a> and<strong> Kenny Chesney</strong>; <a href=#><strong>Richard Gere</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Cindy Crawford</strong></a>; and plenty others, but sadly, their romances didn’t stand the tests of time. Luckily for some, they’ve moved and found new love in their lives.</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see a list of celeb couples you completely forgot about!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46gnKiql5p6pLjOqKWesV2prq21wGaZmqSjlrpufZJtZ3BsXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./identical-twin-sisters-spoke-time-buried-york-cemetery-html.html><span>←</span><span>Identical twin sisters who spoke at the SAME TIME are buried next to each other in York cemetery</span></a>
