After all, their love story is fascinating, their family dynamic is inspiring (Momoa and Bonet's ex, Lenny Kravitz, are pals!), and their synchronized style is pretty darn cute, too. Not only have these two been known to wear his-and-her suits on the red carpet, but they also share a very similar aesthetic and have been dressing alike for years.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Donavon Frankenreiter &amp;amp; Devon Allman Attempt Official World Record With 50 Shows-50 States-50 Days</h2><time>Jul 12, 2024</time>
