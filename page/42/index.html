American Idol Season 21 returned on Sunday night (March 19), which meant&nbsp;a number of talented individuals were photographed waving their golden ticket in the air following an audition.

After Peay's audition, judge and pop superstar Katy Perry called him a "Christian Chris Stapleton."
For his national TV debut, Peay delivered a memorable countrified take on Christian/rock artist Zach Williams’ “To the Table.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How To Watch &amp;amp; Horoscopes</h2><time>Jul 29, 2024</time>

Every year, the Perseid Meteor Shower shoots meteors across the sky—like sparkly, giant space-meatballs. This phenomenon happens from July 17 to August 24 each year, which is something you can take to the bank, babies. Like most relationships, the Perseids like to build up slowly, reach their peak, and then abruptly end. Why Are They Called The Perseids? This particular meteor shower is called the Perseids because they hail from the constellation of Perseus.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>I'm off to Taft School, home of the oldest varsity girls' ice hockey team - YP</h2><time>Jul 29, 2024</time>

Has Meagan Good gone bad?
The actress wore a plunging white gown to the premiere of her new movie "Think Like A Man" that left very little to the imagination.
Costar Gabrielle Union dressed more conservatively, wearing a little black AMSALE dress with sweetheart neckline. A colorful Marina B cocktail ring and J/Hadley diamond drop earrings completed her classy look.
Both actresses looked gorgeous, but Meagan definitely went the risque route.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Meaning of Ill Na Na by JAY-Z</h2><time>Jul 29, 2024</time>

Sticks and stones may break her bones -- but tweets will never hurt her.
Greta Thunberg expertly clapped back at Donald Trump on Tuesday after the President was called out on social media for "bullying" the autistic 16-year-old.
