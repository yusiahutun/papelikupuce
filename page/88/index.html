Things got a bit crazy at last night’s Country Music Television Awards. Sure, Ludacris performing with Jason Aldean and Justin Bieber winning an award were a bit off-the-wall, but the real OMG moments came from the ladies at the show thanks to a dramatic fall from Shania Twain and a peep show by Sheryl Crow.

<a href=../../all-time-voter-registration-record-set-on-dave-matthews-band-tour.html></a>
(CelebrityAccess MediaWire) — Volunteers registered a total of 14,656 voters at Dave Matthews Band concerts this summer, setting an all-time record for a single concert tour. Roughly half of the voters HeadCount registered were age 18 to 24, a population segment that typically has the lowest voter participation rate of any age group.

<a href=../../2000s-tinted-sunglasses-trend.html></a>
Our nation has produced some truly great eyewear moments in its history—Audrey Hepburn’s “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” frames; Lolita’s heart-shaped sunnies; Tom Cruise’s “Top Gun” aviators—but the rhinestone-studded, rainbow-hued, rimless sunglasses that dominated the early 2000s are decidedly not one of them.
If you were paying attention to the Paris Hiltons of the world at the time—or even if you’ve taken a BuzzFeed-enabled trip down nostalgia lane since then—you know exactly what I’m talking about: They could be oversized aviators, ombré-lensed rectangles, or massive, face-hogging shield shades, bathing forehead to cheekbone in a colorful glow.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>DIY Leg Scrub Recipes to Get Your Gams in Gear for Summer</h2><time>May 15, 2024</time>

You’ll never know how much you actually like making things until you have no other choice but to. Such is the case in my home, where I’ve traded Dunkin Donuts for pancakes and ten different body lotions for a tub of shea butter. Now that I’m contemplating a transition to all waste-free products, I’m genuinely eager to start making my own DIY leg scrub and other homemade beauty concoctions.
There are obvious benefits to body exfoliation; dead skin cell turnover, improving skin texture, and nourishing the skin, to name a few.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Miranda Cosgrove Responds to Drake Bell, Brian Peck Sexual Abuse Case</h2><time>May 15, 2024</time>

<a href=../../namor-tenoch-huerta-wakanda-forever-bulge.html></a>
"GIVE NAMOR HIS PENIS BACK" cried one fan, comparing a shot from the trailer to the actual film. Tenoch Huerta spends nearly all of "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever" in a pair of green Speedos, something that comes with the territory when playing Marvel's wing-footed antagonist Namor.
But was his crotch digitally altered in the final cut of the film?
That's a theory that started going around the internet after one fan posted a shot of Huerta from the first trailer released at Comic-Con, compared to a grab seemingly from the movie as it appeared in theaters.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/87/>← Prev Page</a>
