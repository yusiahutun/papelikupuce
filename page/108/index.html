<a href=../../best-dad-jokes.html></a>
What makes a joke a dad joke? Well, when a dad becomes a dad, his sense of humor becomes apparent too. Before he knows it, he’s dropping pun-laden one-liners left and right just like his dad did, and his dad’s dad did, and he may even inherit some mom jokes too. (Is your grandmother funny? That’s usually the biggest tell.)
Even though dad jokes might make us groan, we secretly love these fatherly zingers that are so bad they’re good, and maybe even brilliant.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Burn ban lifted for upper Rock Island County</h2><time>Apr 13, 2024</time>

Guys, we should definitely, definitely talk about these. Here, I’ll go first: I think it’s essential that you not let another tomato season pass without making them. I realize that you might imagine rice-stuffed tomatoes to be something unappealing. Maybe you had a cold, stomach-turning one at a buffet wedding too many years ago that its squidgy horror should still be fresh in your mind, and yet. Maybe you cannot imagine why anyone would consider rice stuffed inside a tomato to be something noteworthy, being just rice and tomatoes, possibly two of the most generic foods out there.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Rita Ora stuns in dramatic red eyeshadow for her Disney acting debut</h2><time>Apr 13, 2024</time>

Ten years ago, Seth Ray found himself standing in a small village in Haiti and knew his life would never be the same. “I had never been out of the country, had never seen poverty,” recalls Ray, 41. “It ruined my life.”&nbsp;
Ray had volunteered for a mission trip through Christ Fellowship Church in Stuart. When he and his fellow volunteers arrived in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, they were met by a local pastor who took them outside the capital city and showed them a dilapidated building that was serving as a school.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Psychology of Money and Happiness</h2><time>Apr 13, 2024</time>
<a href=../../the-psychology-of-money-and-happiness.html></a>
“Money doesn’t buy happiness or does it?”
In 2010, psychologist Daniel Kahneman and economist Angus Deaton attempted to investigate if money impacted people’s psychological well-being, which comprises positive and negative effects and life satisfaction. The study found that money did impact how people evaluate their lives when they think about it; that people with more money feel better about their lives. However, emotional well-being rose with income, as expected too, but only to an annual salary of $75,000 ($90,000 in today’s money).</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/107/>← Prev Page</a>
