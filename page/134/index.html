I’m at the top, you’re at the bottom

Calling out, “And one”
Every time I point and shoot
Yeah, yeah, uh
Uh-huh, uh
(Top-top-top)

I’m at the top, you’re at the bottom
It’s a different point of view

It’s not my best quality, but I have a hard time talking about kale or quinoa with a straight face. When an ingredient is everywhere, when it is treated as if it were the answer to all food questions — what might feed us dinner/a kid be tricked into eating in muffins/be juiced for longevity/and possibly even save the earth — I can’t help but want to rebel against it and both of these ingredients, these darlings of the farm-to-table circuit with their ubiquity on nearly every restaurant menu in lower Manhattan and upper Brooklyn, make easy targets.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>KCMC online application and entry requirements for 2020/2021 intake</h2><time>Mar 2, 2024</time>

Note from Vikki Bynum, Author of “Free State of Jones”: Rachel Knight was a central figure in the Free State of Jones. As collaborator to Newt Knight and the Knight Company, Mississippi’s most notorious band of Civil War deserters, she may have played a pivotal role in the band’s ability to elude Confederate arrest. She is most famous, however, as the mother of several of Newt Knight’s many children. The children born to Rachel, but also to other mixed-race families such as the Smiths and the Ainsworths (with whom the Knights intermarried), comprised complex branches of multiracial descendants who today variously identify themselves as white, brown, black, Indian, or a mixture of all four.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/133/>← Prev Page</a>
