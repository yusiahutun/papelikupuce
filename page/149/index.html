Jason Aldean splurged on a new Mercedes, but he says he's taking it back to the dealer. The "We Back" singer says he'd never owned a car before — until now, it's been nothing but trucks.
Talking to Broadway on Detroit's Nash-FM 93.1, Aldean&nbsp;reveals that he bought a Mercedes AMG GT. It was an impulse buy (the internet says they start at $100,000 new) after he visited a nearby dealer.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Morgan Freeman: 'Learning how to be still, to really be still and let life happen - that stillness b</h2><time>Feb 8, 2024</time>

Learning how to be still, to really be still and let life happen - that stillness becomes a radiance.
In his thought-provoking quote, Morgan Freeman highlights the significance of embracing stillness as a means to allow life to unfold naturally. By learning to be truly still, we unlock a radiance that emanates from within ourselves and positively impacts our existence. This notion, however, can be understood on multiple levels, extending beyond its straightforward meaning.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Suki Waterhouse and Robert Pattinson Are All Bundled Up on a Walk With Their Newborn</h2><time>Feb 8, 2024</time>

So far, Suki Waterhouse and Robert Pattinson’s lives as new parents involves a lot of afternoon strolls. The stars were spotted out and about with their newborn yet again on Saturday afternoon, where they looked especially bundled up on what must have been a chilly one in Los Angeles.
For their walk, Waterhouse sported a baggy pair of black slacks and a long knit cardigan over a button-up. For extra warmth, the “Faded” singer layered another small zip-up jacket on top, and she wrapped a polka-dot-printed scarf around her head.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>All the Winners From Night 3 of the Creative Arts Emmys</h2><time>Feb 7, 2024</time>

I have always hated toner. There, I said it. As a teenager, a&nbsp;harsh-smelling orange bottle of astringent was a crucial element in my skin scouring routine. Sure, it stung and left my face shiny and sore afterwards…but the pain meant it was working, right?&nbsp;Ugh, so wrong. My struggles with the alchohol-based toners of yore scarred me physically and emotionally, and I haven’t tried a toner since. Until now.
Enter Son & Park Beauty Water ($30, Soko Glam), which has&nbsp;changed my life—and my skin.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/148/>← Prev Page</a>
