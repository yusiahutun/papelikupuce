That has changed in recent years. “It is not a gimmick anymore. I think ‘eat local, drink local’ sits well with a lot of people.”
It certainly sits well with a growing number of Hong Kong restaurants, such as Above & Beyond at Hotel Icon, where sommelier Ace Lee likes to pair dishes such as baked spareribs in tomato and vinegar with Grace Vineyard Tasya’s 2012 Reserve Marselan, which is from Shanxi province.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/64/>← Prev Page</a>
