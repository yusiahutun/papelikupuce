The interwar years of the 1920s and 1930s were his heyday, with an entire pavilion devoted to his work at the 1920 Venice Biennale. Following his death in 1949, little was thought of the painter or his work for decades, until&nbsp;a previously hidden collection of Beltrán&nbsp;Masses work emerged, which forms the basis of this exhibition, organised by Stair Sainty.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Glenn Close on Robin Williams and Christopher Reeve's Deaths</h2><time>Jul 4, 2024</time>
