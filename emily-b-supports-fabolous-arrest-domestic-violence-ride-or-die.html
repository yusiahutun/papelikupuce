He turned himself in and was cited for the incident, which is serious stuff. Even though there’s drama going down now, a source close to the Emily tells <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> EXCLUSIVELY that their 16-year relationship has simply had a lot of highs and lows.”Emily has been with&nbsp;<span class=il>Fabolous</span>&nbsp;a long time and things have always been passionate between the two. They have broken up and gotten back together a bunch of times, which is hard on a relationship,” the insider tells us.</p><p>“While they have a lot of love for each other, Emily sometimes feels neglected and taken for granted too. She has always wanted him to do the right thing and get married. Sometimes things get a little hectic or rocky between the two of them, but she has always been his ride or die woman and she still hates that he won’t put a ring on it,” our source adds.</p><p>Fabolous and Emily — real name&nbsp;Emily Bustamante –have been dating since 2002. They have two sons together —&nbsp;<strong>Johan Jackson</strong>, 10, and&nbsp;<strong>Jonas Jackson</strong>, 2, and she’s the star of Love and Hip Hop. No wonder she’s been wanting to get married, they’ve been together long enough. Just look at this pic of the couple and their kids at a New York Knicks game last month! What a cute family.</p><p>So far neither Fabolous or Emily have publicly commented on what went down between them, but in hours before the alleged incident, he posted a pic alongside rap legend <strong>Beanie Siegel</strong> and tour mate <strong>JadaKiss</strong> and wrote “you gon lose homies, girls, friendships, relationships, and even family… but as long as you don’t lose yourself, you winning!” Hmmm… does that family include Emily and the kids??? We’ve reached out to reps for both Fab and Emily and haven’t heard back.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH10e5FyZp6lmaHGbq6MrKypqJ%2BnwbR5xZqZqKSfqsBurdGrnKysXZm8rrHSraCcZaaevK2xzZycZqqZmbJuu9Fmm6KdXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./royal-mother-of-the-bride-wedding-outfits.html><span>←</span><span>Royal mother-of-the-bride wedding outfits: from Sarah Ferguson and Carole Middleton to Camilla Parke</span></a>
