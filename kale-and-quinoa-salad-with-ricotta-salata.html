It was really just a matter of time before I fell for a salad at a local restaurant that contained both kale and quinoa and it was so good, it became an obsession. I had to have it <a href=#>everyday</a> and this quickly became expensive and so I made it at home. Everyone needs a good lunch salad (well, except maybe those people on the beach last week in string bikinis eating cheeseburgers and fries?). A good lunch salad, as my friend Tracy recently put more eloquently, is like <a href=#>a reset button</a>. It also means that if you end up working late, losing momentum and having a slice of pizza for dinner, all hopes of nutritional balance for the day were not washed down the drain with it. True story: You only need to eat like a grown-up during one meal of a day to pass yourself off as one. (Fine, I just made this rule up, but I say we run run with it.)</p><p><a title=quinoa href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2818/12952029323_2b23d6936c_z.jpg alt=quinoa data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="quinoa, cherries, almonds, kale, dill, lemon" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2868/12951892325_528c5fb1c0_z.jpg alt="quinoa, cherries, almonds, kale, dill, lemon" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>I miss the salad bar salads I’d get every day (applying a strong dose of cognitive dissonance to what they probably cost over the course of each month) when I had an office job. The beauty of salad bars is that you can put sixteen ingredients on a salad without actually having to keep sixteen ingredients fresh and chopped at-the-ready at home, which is good because that would just never happen. This salad, with just a few ingredients, manages to hit all of the notes a good salad should — leafy greens, bulk from quinoa, a little sweet-tartness from the dried cherries, crunch and flavor from the deeply toasted almonds, salty cheese and a little extra fragrance from lemon zest and dill — without requiring you keep a veritable salad bar at home. Just about everything can be prepped a few days out and tossed together as needed.</p><p><a title="kale quinoa salad with ricotta salata" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3792/12952038773_a0056052dc_z.jpg alt="kale quinoa salad with ricotta salata" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href=#>Chocolate-Hazelnut Macaroon Torte</a> (I’m making a gigantic version of this for my FIL’s birthday this weekend.

Right, that old thing. In the book, I tried to teach myself, a kale resistor, to be a kale lover and I did so by taking it back to the 1990s, when restaurants discovered that if you add dried fruit, toasted nuts, a crumbly salty cheese and a honey-and-dijon vinaigrette to any previously unappetizing pile of salad greens, it will taste delicious. Here, the dried fruit is dried cherries (but The Smith uses dried cranberries), the toasted nuts are almonds, the honey-Dijon is barely sweet and uses coarse Dijon as well. From The Smith I learned to add a little snippet of dill, a touch of grated lemon zest and cooked, cooled quinoa to make the salad that I’m literally counting down the minutes to lunch so that I can have it again.</p><p>Yield: 2 to 3 quite large meal salads or 4 to 5 side salads; salad will wilt a bit and <i>seem</i> smaller the longer it sits with the dressing</p><p><u>Salad</u><br>1/2 cup uncooked quinoa (or 1 1/2 cups cooked)<br>8 ounces Black Kale, also known as Cavolo Nero, or Lacinato, Dinosaur, or Tuscan Kale<br>1/2 cup slivered almonds, very well toasted and cooled<br>1/3 cup dried cherries, chopped a bit<br>2 to 3 scallions, thinly sliced<br>2 teaspoons chopped fresh dill<br>2 ounces ricotta salata, crumbled or finely grated<br>Few gratings of fresh lemon zest</p><p><u>Dressing</u><br>3 tablespoons olive oil<br>1 1/2 tablespoons white wine vinegar<br>2 teaspoons smooth Dijon mustard<br>1 teaspoon coarse Dijon mustard<br>Just shy of 1 teaspoon honey<br>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</p><p>Rinse quinoa well in a small colander. This is essential to remove bitterness. Place quinoa and 1 1/2 cups water in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer with a couple pinches of salt. Simmer at a very low temperature for 15 to 20 minutes, until tender. Drain any un-absorbed liquid from cooked quinoa. Spread quinoa on a plate to cool quickly.</p><p>Wash your kale and dry it well. Then, with a knife, remove the rib from each stalk, leaving long strips of kale leaves. Stack the leaves in small batches, roll them tightly the long way, and cut the roll crosswise into thin ribbons. Add the kale ribbons to a large salad bowl. Add remaining salad ingredients to kale and toss to mix.</p><p>Whisk dressing ingredients together in a small dish, and pour the dressing over the salad. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then dig in.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-11559 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-11559 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
