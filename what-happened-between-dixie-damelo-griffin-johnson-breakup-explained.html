However, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Dixie confirmed they’d split</a> only a month later in a video chronicling their final date together. “Hey, so we actually broke up,” Dixie prefaced the Aug. 2 video. “But I had this video scheduled for today so I’m posting it anyways. It was fun.”</p><p>What happened between the two posts was messy, to say the least. On July 6, fellow Tiktok star Chase Hudson — the ex of Dixie’s sister Charli —<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> tweeted that Griffin had cheated on Dixie</a> with two girls. Shortly afterward, a TikTok user named <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Madison Galley threatened</a> to “expose Griffin Johnson,” posting screenshots of the Sway House member DMing her on Snapchat and claiming to be single. In the days before Dixie posted her video of their last date, she and Griffin also unfollowed each other on social media.</p><p>About a month later, the exes began addressing their breakup publicly. Griffin claimed in a Sept. 12 <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>video with Bryce Hall</a> that he “did Snapchat a girl” and jokingly asked her to “send toes,” but denied ever cheating. (Dixie indirectly responded by <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>tweeting a photo of her own toes</a> the same day). Griffin then doubled down, releasing a track called “Convenient” on which he sang that the cheating claims were “f*cked up” and implied that Dixie was dating Noah Beck, a fellow member of the Sway House. (Both Noah and Dixie denied being more than friends at the time).</p><p></p><p>Dixie initially laughed the song off, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>joking to </a>Hollywood Fix that she “[couldn’t] sleep at night,” but later posted a <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>TikTok video to the tune of “Convenient”</a> during which she shared receipts regarding the cheating allegations. Among them were multiple screenshots including what appeared to be an apology text from Griffin “own[ing] up to it completely” and admitting to hurting Dixie “in a way that can never be forgiven or forgotten.”</p><p>Afterward, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Griffin admitted to “f*cking up”</a> in a Sept. 23 tweet. “I’m not perfect. God knows I’m not even close but time for others to admit the same,” he wrote. That wasn’t the end of the drama, though. During a November appearance on the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>BFFs featuring Josh Richards and Dave Portnoy</a> podcast, Griffin further defended himself by explaining that he had responded to a Snapchat DM during a “four or five day period” during which he and Dixie were on a break and he was feeling sad. “I did my fair share of wrongs,” he conceded. “I should have never messaged the girl at all, not going to lie, but it was during a weird break up, I was just messed up in the head at the time.” What’s more, <a href=# class=T3D>Dixie did eventually begin dating Noah</a> about a month after her breakup from Griffin, but Griffin claimed a romance between them started before then.</p><p>Appearing on the same podcast in May, Dixie explained that <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>she’d moved on from the contentious breakup</a>. “It was just a dumb, immature relationship,” she said. “We shouldn't have been dating in the first place. We were cooler as friends.” She added that while she’s “not friends” with Griffin anymore, she harbors “no bad blood” toward him.</p><p>That’s not to say <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Griffin and Noah’s friendship</a> wasn’t affected. “I love Noah and I don't really care about the past. I still consider him one of my friends, but it definitely puts a weird thing between us in a way,” Griffin told People in December. “I wish it could just be over and I could carry on normally and not have to worry about that.”</p><p>He may not feel the same way after watching The D’Amelio Show.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZrCgkal6qa3PqZynnZRir6bA1p6cp2WUnsWqsYydmKadnKR6qL7In52ipl2fvKm60qilZpqimq6swc9mnLGonJa2r7HD</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./spinach-quiche-revisited.html><span>←</span><span>spinach quiche, revisited</span></a>
