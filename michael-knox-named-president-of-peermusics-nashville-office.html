Knox is delivering career-making opportunities for our writers.”</p><p>Prior to joining peermusic, Michael Knox opened Nashville’s first song plugging company HIT PLUGGERS in 1991 and also served as Vice President at Warner Chappell where he oversaw writer and artist development, song placements and the catalogs of songwriters such as Jason Aldean, John Rich, Gretchen Wilson, Emily West, and Jeff Stevens, among others.</p><p>He also launched the Music Knox REcords label with BBR Music Group/BMG and signed Tim Montana to his label in 2020.</p><p>“For over 94 years, the Peers have been widely considered the first family of country music publishing with a history of delivering ‘firsts’ in the industry. I jumped at the invitation to be a part of this publishing team 12 years ago and to work alongside some of the best and most trusted music publishers in the business. The important legacy that we’re building upon here in Nashville, our commitment to continue delivering ‘firsts’ for songwriters, and the genuine connections we have with our peermusic writers is something that I’m flat-out proud to be a part of. I’m thankful to Kathy, Mary Megan Peer, Ralph Peer II, and our peermusic team for this opportunity.”</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ39wfY9oaHJnnZ6wqa3EpWSkpp%2Bteq%2BtzJ6bZqiimsCqsMSnq2anlmK9prHRpqysoZOoeq%2Bt0qGtoqScmnqwssWimp5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-aniston-chic-cinched-leg-lengthening-look-sky-high-heels.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Aniston looks so chic for red carpet appearance as she teases The Morning Show season 4</span></a>
