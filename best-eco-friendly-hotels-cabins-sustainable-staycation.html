This ensures that the money you spend while travelling stays exactly where it belongs – in the local community.</p><p id=eIVyeXLzMx><strong>Travel slow</strong></p><p id=e5Dg_Xkv5y>Take fewer trips but stay for longer, truly immersing yourself in a destination and culture rather than multiple fly-and-flop holidays. Travel off the typical tourist trail so the benefits of tourism are spread out to rural areas.&nbsp;</p><p id=e7BRQPyrAc><strong>Pack mindfully</strong></p><p id=ecz2929uJu>Simple things like packing a reusable water bottle and packing a reusable bag can help reduce single-use plastic while travelling. Also consider packing solid soap and shampoo bars to avoid packing miniature plastic bottles that end up in landfill. &nbsp;</p><p id=enu8EB28P2><strong>Keep your good habits while abroad</strong></p><p id=e0t0BH9XpS>We make such an effort to recycle and minimise single-use plastic when we’re at home, but research shows this can be forgotten when we travel. Make a conscious choice to keep your good habits with you while you travel and try to live as the locals do.</p><p id=e3ur0b-P75><strong>Enjoy overland adventures</strong></p><p id=eFoJ4h2gNw>Consider taking the train where possible instead of flying – you’ll get to skip airport lines, you’ll enjoy a far more scenic journey, and you’ll arrive right in the centre of town. Hop on the Eurostar to Paris then try Intrepid’s Paris to Madrid to explore some of Europe’s highlights without the hassle of airport queues or long driving days.</p><p id=e10Ef-d_t3l data-wc=14><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>How can you live a more sustainable life?
