She discussed her experiences as a mother on Instagram, especially her attempts to carve out time for herself on a regular basis. She talked about the strains of postpartum depression, which most women experience after having a baby. In order to bring attention to the reality of postpartum depression, she also posted a picture of herself in bed without makeup. She made the observation that there isn’t enough discussion about the illness, particularly in light of its severity.</p><p>Ileana D’Cruz said on Instagram, “Hi…”I haven’t put a photo of myself on here in a long. Between being a full-time mother and housewife, I don’t seem to have time for myself. I’m usually in pjs and a sloppy unattractive mom bun to keep my hair away from my munchkin’s little grabby hands, so the idea of pouting for a selfie doesn’t really cross my head haha. To be honest, some days have been quite difficult. Sleep deprivation does not help lol.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>The First Feeling of Becoming a Mother</a></strong></p><p>“I’m not trying to come across as complaining, because this precious child has been the most amazing thing to happen to me. However, we don’t discuss postpartum depression enough. It’s extremely real. And it’s a really alienating feeling. And I’m trying every day to make time to make myself feel better. A 30-minute workout followed by a 5-minute shower following is quite effective. But occasionally, I can’t manage that.”, she further added.</p><p>She also states that there have been so many amazing things that have happened to her, and it’s been an emotional overwhelming journey. She says that she isn’t just one of those moms who can bounce back immediately. She’s being kinder on herself and her body and getting to a stronger, healthy ‘her’, but at her own pace. On August 5, last year, Ileana announced on Instagram that she had given birth to a baby boy named Koa Phoenix Dolan and in her caption she conveyed that no words could express how delighted she and her husband are to welcome her “ darling boy” into the world.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>The Toxicity of “A Mother’s Strength”</a></strong></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Few Ways to Cope with Postpartum Depression</h4><p>After having a baby, you may experience a wide range of emotions. You may experience emotions ranging from delight to fear to melancholy. If your feelings of melancholy worsen and interfere with your daily life, you may be suffering from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">postpartum depression</a> (PPD).</p><p>Symptoms typically appear within a few weeks following delivery, but can last up to six months. Symptoms may include mood changes, difficulties bonding with your infant, and problems thinking or making decisions.</p><li><strong>Exercise: </strong>According to researchers in Australia, exercise may have an antidepressant impact on women with PPD. Walking with a baby in a stroller, in particular, could be a simple way to get some exercise and fresh air. According to a study published in Mental Health and Physical Activity, walking is a statistically significant approach to alleviate depression.</li><li><strong>Healthy diet: </strong>Healthy nutrition alone will not heal PPD. Still, developing the practice of eating nutritious foods can help you feel better while also providing your body with necessary nutrients. Try planning your week’s meals over the weekend and even making healthy snacks ahead of time.</li><li><strong>Make time for yourself:</strong> Breastfeeding on the couch can make you feel stuck. Perhaps your older kids, your household duties, or your job is overwhelming you. Seek assistance rather than attempting to manage these difficulties on your own. Give the infant to your partner or another responsible adult for a couple of hours.</li>References+<ul><li>Ileana D’Cruz on Mental Health, opens up about postpartum depression and sleep deprivation.
