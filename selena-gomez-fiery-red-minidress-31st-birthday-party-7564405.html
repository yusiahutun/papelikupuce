Picking out a head-turner of an outfit for her star-studded birthday party, Selena opted for a fiery red minidress that featured a strapless silhouette and was covered in floral appliqués and fringe.&nbsp;She accessorized with a pair of coordinating black stilettos with straps that traveled up her calves, silver hoops, and, at one point, black shield sunglasses. Selena pulled her long brunette waves back into a sultry updo, and swiped on a nude lip, bronze eyeshadow, and winged liner.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"31," she captioned a carousel of photos from her party that hosted famous guests, including Paris Hilton, Christina Aguilera, Karol G., and Sabrina Claudio.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Selena Gomez Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following her party, Selena enjoyed a private screening of the new Barbie movie with friends, and they all dressed in coordinating head-to-toe pink outfits. Selena, for her part, wore a fuchsia-colored halter-neck dress with a matching shade of lipstick and a giant pink cocktail ring.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Selena Gomez Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earlier in the day, Selena reflected on what she's thankful this birthday in a heartfelt post shared to Instagram. "I am thankful for so much in my life and one of the things I am most thankful for is the work we’ve been able to do with the Rare Impact Fund through @Rarebeauty," she wrote, adding: "Because of YOU we’ve been able to raise awareness and increase access to mental health services for young people. This is my true passion in life."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570p6jnqaRYrSwucSzZJ%2BhlafGbr7EnWSmoZ6esbOx0qxkbGmjqXqjtdGtn52ZqWK9or7TsmRwbWZpgXGB</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ishikawa-hopes-become-japans-only-openly-gay-member-parliament.html><span>←</span><span>Ishikawa hopes to become Japans only openly gay member of parliament</span></a>
