Editors <i>love</i> this, by the way, almost as much as mine loved the ten recipes I swapped in in December and the three in January, and the introduction that I didn’t write until February. Seriously, just let me know if you ever want me to write that How Not To Write A Book Book.</p><p><a title="and then divides" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4400/37060870322_7e9b4fd3f8_z.jpg alt="and then divides" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>What a tease, however, that this isn’t <i>that</i> marble cake. (That one is really good though! I thought I’d hand it off to friends and my family basically blockaded the door.) (Geez, Deb, stop rubbing it in.) What I wanted to tell you today is what happened after I figured out how I wanted to marble the cake, which is that I found it so much fun, I couldn’t stop. I started marbling <i>everything</i>. Marbled chocolate graham crackers. Marbled gingerbread bars. And then one day I even made marbled banana bread and I shared it on Instagram Stories and I don’t think I have ever received so many requests for a recipe.</p><p><a title="start checkerboarding dollops of batter" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4357/36835044330_f5b454a43a_z.jpg alt="start checkerboarding dollops of batter" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="a few more alternated dollops" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4345/36835044170_2ff88c8298_z.jpg alt="a few more alternated dollops" width=640 height=426 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>At my typically snail-like pace of output, this brings us up to today. Banana bread is perfect fall/back-to-<a href=#>school</a> food anyway, can we pretend I “meant” to do that? And this version, which is <a href=#>50% this jacked-up classic</a> (my favorite) and <a href=#>50% this double-dark chocolate version</a> (seemingly everyone else on earth’s favorite) is thus the literal definition of “best of both worlds.” I know for a fact that all of our weekends will be better with this in it.</p><p><a title="stop before you go too far" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4428/37060870162_69ae315f4d_z.jpg alt="stop before you go too far" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="marbled banana bread" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4388/36835043890_f8a634b771_z.jpg alt="marbled banana bread" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop=name>Marbled Banana Bread</h3><ul class=jetpack-recipe-meta><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop=recipeYield><strong>Servings: </strong>8 to 10</li><li class=jetpack-recipe-time><strong>Time:</strong> <span class=time>45 minutes</span></li><li class=jetpack-recipe-print><a href=#>Print</a></li></ul><br><br><ul><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>3 large very ripe bananas</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/2 cup (115 grams) unsalted butter, melted</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>3/4 cup (145 grams) light brown sugar</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 large egg</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 teaspoon baking soda</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/4 teaspoon table or fine sea salt</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 cup (130 grams) plus 1/4 cup (35 grams) all-purpose flour</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/4 cup (about 20 grams) dark cocoa powder (I use Dutched but any kind should work), sifted if lumpy</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>3/4 cup (130 grams) chocolate chips</li></ul><br>Heat oven to 350°F. Butter a 9×5-inch loaf pan, or coat it with a nonstick baking spray.<p>Melt butter in the bottom of a large bowl in the microwave. Mash the bananas right into it until mostly smooth. Whisk in brown sugar, egg, vanilla, baking soda, and salt until thoroughly combined. Add <b>1 cup</b> of the flour, stirring just until it disappears.</p><p>Pour half of batter into a second bowl. (You can eyeball it, it’s fine. Or you can know that my batter halves were roughly 365 grams each, but weights will vary with banana sizes.) Into one bowl, stir the remaining 1/4 cup of flour and ground cinnamon. Into the other bowl, stir in the cocoa powder and chocolate chips.</p><p>Dollop batters in large (see pictures above for an idea of size) alternating spoonfuls into bottom of prepared loaf pan. Attempt to “checkerboard” the rest in, roughly meaning that you’ll drop a chocolate batter dollop on top of a chocolate-free one and vice-versa until both batters are used up. Use a butter knife or small offset spatula to make a few figure-8s through the batters, marbling them together — but just a little, say, 2 to 3 figure-8s. Any more and the swirls may not look distinct when you cut the cake.</p><p>Bake 55 to 65 minutes, until a tester or toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out batter-free. (A melted chocolate chip smear is expected, however.) Cool in pan for 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge and invert it out onto a cooling rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p><p>Do ahead: The banana bread will keep for up to 4 days at room temperature. I keep mine wrapped in foil.</p><br><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-33487 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-33487 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
