However, after they stepped down from their royal duties three years ago, there was a period of replacement. Instead of Meghan and Harry, it became Prince Edward and his wife Sophie who would step out with <a href=#>Prince William</a> and his wife.</p><p>Of Harry and Meghan, William, and <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a>, he writes: “The two couples commanded global attention and gave the monarchy a new shine and allure. It barely lasted two years. William and Kate have done their best to keep some of that momentum going since Harry and Meghan’s departure, and Kate is assuredly the last glamorous figure in the lineup as William assures a more stolid role, but there is an unmistakable void. And one that is harder to fill than they ever expected.”</p><p>He says that “a soft-spoken prince more at home in the West End or on Broadway than on the royal stage” did nothing to help interest younger generations in the royal family. Nor, did it help with the 2021 tell-all that Harry and Meghan did with <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a>.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Prince Harry and William had ‘fun night’ partying with Paris Hilton at ‘$400-dollar-a-night hotel’</a></p><p>He points to a particularly cutting remark in which Sophie said of Oprah: “You know, if you’re not into chat shows, there’s no reason why you should know who she is. Certainly not in this country, any-way.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-king-charles-is-frustrating-the-royal-family>King Charles is ‘frustrating’ the royal family</h2><p><a href=#>King Charles had an “awkward” chat with his youngest son</a>, according to Scobie’s book. A friend told the author: “It was an awkward conversation, but he knew if he didn’t make those first steps, there would never be any progress.”</p><p>He claims that though there was no screaming matches between <a href=#>King Charles</a> and his son, the conversation wasn’t an open one and was instead “cold and brief rather than open to any proper dialogue.”</p><p>A source said that it was “frustrating” other members of the royals that Charles wasn’t patching things up. “It’s complex, but there’s increasing frustration from some of the wider family members that Charles won’t just fix things for everyone.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-king-was-told-to-swallow-his-pride>King was told to ‘swallow his pride’</h2><p>Elsewhere, in the book, Scobie writes that a former member of staff at Clarence House said that <a href=#>the King was told to “swallow his pride”</a> when it came to Harry and Meghan. This included being told to do so by <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth</a>.</p><p>“A former Clarence House staff member said King Charles was encouraged by senior aides and, on at least one occasion, the Queen herself to swallow his pride. “Just tell him what he needs to hear…’ That’s what was said,” admitted the former employee.”</p><p>A source also added: “Instead, Charles chose to say nothing and turn the other way as the Sussexes shared their story via Netflix in December 2022 and Harry’s memoir a month later.”</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=#>King Charles ignores latest royal drama in first appearance after bombshell book</a></strong></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2V%2BcL7OspilZZKkvKx5wqWYoqWjYsGprdNmqZ6onJawqrrGZqeroZ6Ysm60wKupsmWRo7FuucSgn5qmXaKus7fLnmSfmZmhsqV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-corden-told-pal-mathew-27893240.html><span>←</span><span>James Corden told pal Mathew Horne refused interview with him in resurfaced clip</span></a>
