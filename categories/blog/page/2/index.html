Banga was venturing into highly political territory. In market economies, the freedom to deploy investment at will – however serious or frivolous the objective – is almost sacred. State or any other kind of dirigiste intervention is not normally welcomed.
In state economies, the opposite is true and private enterprise has to walk a fine line between freedom and the threat of repression, as is the case in China. So, the kind of pragmatic compromise Banga was suggesting is bold and worth hearing.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Liberty beauty Christmas crackers are back</h2><time>Oct 7, 2024</time>
