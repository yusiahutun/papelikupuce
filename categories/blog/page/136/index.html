Drake skipped the 2024 Grammys, as he was too busy on tour with J. Cole, but it didn’t stop his 2019 speech circulating the internet, which some claim is “the greatest speech ever.”

If you take a look at this poster for Gangster Squad — and can train your eyes on anything other than Sean Penn’s enormous gun — you’ll notice Emma Stone there in the bottom right. She’s giving her best Jolie Leg, it’s true. But the sexy woman she really reminds us of is Jessica Rabbit.
