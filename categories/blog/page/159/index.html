<a href=../../../../lisa-says-gah-nordstrom.html></a>
You know that friend who always looks so effortlessly chic and put together? She probably shops at Madewell. It’s no wonder, really, considering it's the sister brand to J.Crew — the label well known for sophisticated and classy attire. We at InStyle have a bit of an affinity for Madewell. Not just because half of our team walks around the office in their ultra-comfy jeans (although it’s a big reason), but because whenever we feel like we need something that has a lot of boxes to check, like quality fabrics, durable materials, affordable price tag, and trendy cute designs, Madewell meets us at every point.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Lefsetz Letter: The Jimmy Buffett Tribute At The Hollywood Bowl</h2><time>Jan 1, 1</time>
<a href=../../../../the-lefsetz-letter-the-jimmy-buffett-tribute-at-the-hollywood-bowl.html></a>
All you have to know is Paul McCartney came to serenade Jimmy on his deathbed. Jimmy knew everybody, and everybody loved him.
Now when my mother died, my older sister said she wanted “She did it all” on her tombstone. Jimmy Buffett truly did it all. When I think of his time on Earth I feel inadequate. Talk about eating up life… It’s very sad he was cut down short, and I’m sure there was more he wanted to do, but when it comes to living life to the fullest, I know no one who has done that to the extent of Jimmy Buffett.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Top 40 Country Songs for April 2023 [Power Rankings]</h2><time>Jan 1, 1</time>
<a href=../../../../top-40-country-songs-april-2023.html></a>
If you're expecting Morgan Wallen and Luke Combs to dominate the Taste of Country Top 40 Country Songs list for April 2023 because both released albums that are dominating other charts, you'd be right.
The "Last Night" singer has four songs vs. two for Combs, but neither is No. 1 this month. That slot goes to a rising country female that — honestly — has risen. Lainey Wilson's dominance is secure as she nears a second straight No.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>US passenger rebuked for not wearing bra on Delta flight wants meeting with airline boss</h2><time>Jan 1, 1</time>

A woman who says she was threatened with being kicked off a US Delta Air Lines flight because she was not wearing a bra demanded a meeting with the company’s top boss on Thursday over what she says is a discriminatory policy.
