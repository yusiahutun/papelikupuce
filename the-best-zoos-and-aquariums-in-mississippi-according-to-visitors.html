<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>The best zoos and aquariums in Mississippi, according to visitors | State</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Whether you're looking to occupy the kids for a day or take that special someone out on a date, zoos and aquariums can serve as great outings for all ages.</p><p>As of September 2023, <a href=#>the Association of Zoos and Aquariums</a> reports that there are 213 AZA-accredited zoos and aquariums in the United States, which see about 183 million visitors each year. Though zoos and aquariums have often been maligned for keeping animals in captivity, AZA-accredited facilities provide much more than a chance to ogle caged lions or fish in a tank. Visiting one may afford you a valuable opportunity to help your favorite wild animals.</p><p>AZA-accredited zoos and aquariums are committed to promoting species conservation and animal welfare, <a href=#>prioritizing caring for endangered animals</a> and funding initiatives to preserve natural habitats like savannas and rainforests. Buying an entrance ticket (and maybe a souvenir or two) can help support ecological conservation efforts both inside and outside the zoo or aquarium, so you can enjoy your visit knowing that your purchases are going to good use.</p><p>Besides showcasing exotic species from faraway locations, zoos and aquariums also often feature restaurants and concession stands, educational programs, and unique activities, making them a great choice for a fun day out.</p><p>Of course, certain zoos and aquariums are better than others, standing out among the ranks thanks to their exhibits, high-quality dining options, increased accessibility, and more. To help you plan your next trip, <a href=#>Stacker</a> compiled a list of the best zoos and aquariums in Mississippi, according to Tripadvisor. Tripadvisor ranks businesses using a combination of metrics, including overall rating, reviews, and number of page views. As a result, a business with a 5/5 overall rating might rank lower than one with a 4/5. Data is as of February 2024. Zoos and aquariums that are AZA-accredited are noted accordingly.</p><p>Note: The photos in this article are stock images and do not depict the zoos or aquariums listed.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/analytics.stacker.com/tracking/a3975941-0a98-48ba-8b5b-91861ca93faf/pixel.gif?source=feed" height=1 width=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwv9Oaq55npJ2ybq7ErKtmsp%2BkwG6tzZ1kmqmllr%2BqwcysZKKmXaK2tL%2FIrKqiqKCeeqKvwqipnaGenHq1u4yvoKyhpKS%2FtHvCqKOlnZOptrC6vm9sn2hoa4N1eZWcbHFlZZeyp3nBbXBrZWhqsHqBmJyYn5loZXupwMyl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./party-paupers-nigerias-financial-crisis-puts-the-brakes-on-detty-december-celebrations.html><span>←</span><span>Party paupers: Nigerias financial crisis puts the brakes on Detty December celebrations</span></a>
