Chrissy, who’s now dating This Is Us cameraman Josh Stancil, recently got some fangirl love from <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a> at an event. “I’m learning so much about myself,” Chrissy says of navigating the exciting life changes success has brought her. “Every day is a gift.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46cn6uho6jGbrnErbFmrJiewG610masrGWTna6zrcKtnKtlYWp%2FdH%2BSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./morgan-wallen-concert-tour-of-2023-peoples-choice-country-awards.html><span>←</span><span>Morgan Wallen Wins Concert Tour of 2023 at People's Choice</span></a>
