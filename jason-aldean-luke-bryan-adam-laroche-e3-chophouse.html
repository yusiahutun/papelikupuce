Along with former MLB player Adam LaRoche, the country singers are planning for E3 Chophouse to open this fall.</p><p>Unlike so many of the bars and restaurants attached to celebrities in Nashville, this new upscale steakhouse will be located in Hillsboro Village, west of downtown. The <a href=#>Tennessean</a> talked to LaRoche, who says his friendship with Bryan dates back 15 years and his friendship with Aldean blossomed several years ago after the singer performed the National Anthem at an Atlanta Braves game. They all became hunting buddies, and co-owners of the Buck Commander brand of hunting products.</p><p>"I’m literally on the phone with Jason talking about and going back and forth on which fabric we’re going to use for the booths upstairs," LaRoche says, detailing the level of participation the two busy singers are bringing. Both have restaurants named for them on Lower Broadway, the main tourist strip in Nashville. Jason Aldean's Kitchen + Rooftop Bar and Luke Bryan's 32 Bridge are next door to one another. E3 Chophouse will open this fall at 1628 21st Avenue S.</p><p><strong>Nashville's Best Celebrity Bars? We Reviewed 6 of Them!</strong></p><p>E3 will be a tri-level eatery with a rooftop bar. The&nbsp;beef will be provided by LaRoche's E3 Ranch in Kansas. It's all-natural with no hormones, steroids or antibiotics. This is the second E3 Chophouse, following a location in Steamboat Springs, Colo. that opened in 2013. Aldean and Bryan are not affiliate with that restaurant.</p><p>Other country singers with dining properties in Nashville include <a href=#>Dierks Bentley</a>, <a href=#>Blake Shelton</a>, and <a href=#>Florida Georgia Line</a>. <a href=#>Alan Jackson</a> also has a bar that does not serve food. <a href=#>Johnny Cash</a> and <a href=#>Merle Haggard</a>'s names are attached to new eateries in town but both opened long after the legend's deaths.</p><p><strong>See Country Music's 10 Hottest Men!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo5mjpLturcudnJqmXaHCrLGMm6mymZ5irqWtzGajmqqfmLWmecRsZJygn6W1sMHSnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./automet-quarter-zip-sweatshirt-review-amazon-8379878.html><span>←</span><span>I Dont Want to Take Off This Soft and Cozy $24 Amazon Sweatshirt</span></a>
