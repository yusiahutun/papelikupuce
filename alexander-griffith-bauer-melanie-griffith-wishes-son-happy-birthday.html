She added, “#myboys #birthday #family #proudmama.” <strong>Take a look at the photo below!</strong></p><p>People were loving the post, as they took to the comments section to respond. “He’s beautiful! Happy Birthday Alexander!” one fan said. “I admire your family’s strong bonds with one another. I especially love that all of the parents welcome each other’s children and stepchildren. You guys are the model of how it should be!” another added.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Working Girl</a> star shares Alexander with her ex-husband, Steven Bauer. The pair tied the knot after Melanie split ways with her first husband, actor&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Don Johnson</strong></a>. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miami&nbsp;Vice</a> alum is Jesse’s dad, as he and his former partner, actress Patti D’Arbanville welcomed him in 1982 — however, Melanie sees him like her own son!</p><p>Aside from Alexander, the&nbsp;Now and Then costar welcomed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two other kids</a> — daughters&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Dakota Johnson</strong></a> and&nbsp;Stella Banderas — the latter shared with actor&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Antonio Banderas</strong></a>. Even though Melanie finds herself having to coparent, she has admitted that she will always have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">positive feelings towards the men in her life</a>.</p><p>“All of my husbands, my three husbands — I love them all so much, and we’re all very close,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">InStyle</a>&nbsp;in an interview. We can also forget about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Globes</a> winner walking down the aisle again.</p><p>“I really don’t think it’s relevant for anyone anymore. But especially if you’re 60 and you have four kids and you’re living the life you’ve always wanted. Then why get married?” shed told the outlet. “It’s, like, I would love to fall in love and have a romance, a relationship, but I haven’t. I keep looking. I’ve had a couple of lovers but not a relationship.” So true!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46ao56wkaOxpr6MoKminpaewal5wZqsnqpdorKtrc2inGafop6zp7XToWSwoaOdsrR50qilZqCRpb26ecGiqa2glJbGcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joan-severance.html><span>←</span><span>Joan Severance Biography</span></a>
