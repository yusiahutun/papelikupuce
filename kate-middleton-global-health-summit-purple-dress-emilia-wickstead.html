Dressed for the momentous occasion; the mother-of-three looked incredible in a lilac, fit and flare dress by Emilia Wickstead. She first wore the striking design when she was pictured leaving Berlin for Hamburg as part of the Royal Tour in&nbsp;&nbsp;2017. Kate wore her trademark brunette hair - which looked like it had had <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>a smattering of copper low lights</a> </strong>- in a loose, lightly curled style, and brown eyeshadow, a subtle flick of mascara and nude lipgloss highlighted her pretty features. The wife of<strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince William</a></strong> looked to be in great spirits as she arrived.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7faee366e0bd-kate-middleton-prince-william-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eqxZIOj-n0Ja data-wc=6><strong>Duchess Kate looked stunning in purple</strong></p><p id=ehTAp_dH79ra data-wc=74>The event was attended by political figures, experts and policy makers who proceeded to discuss issues such as how to deal with the stigma attached to mental health - a subject very close to the royal's heart. A major policy up for discussion was the declaration committing to putting mental health on an equal footing with physical health. The royal pair have long been involved in mental health initiatives through their Heads Together campaign.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=eZgVDprmRY5Z data-wc=51>Duchess Kate only returned to royal duties last week after taking maternity leave with little Prince Louis. Even though she was dressed down in her most casual attire at a forest school in London, she still looked incredible, stepping out in her favourite Zara jeans and a patterned shirt by Joseph.</p><p id=eu-uJ6aEGdOm data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>6 outfits Kate Middleton may re-wear for Princess Eugenie's royal wedding</a></strong></p><p id=eXOlcFuzbied data-wc=94>Her choice of boots hit the headlines that day too - the 'Long Leather Tassel Boots'&nbsp;from Penelope Chilvers, retail for £475 from the high-end brand. Kate first wore them almost 15 years ago whilst a student at St Andrew's University, and has been seen in them ever since. The style is simple and classic - there's no over embellishment, no painful heel as they are sturdy, they are plain, timeless and easy to wear with a skirt, dress or trousers. No wonder Kate keeps reverting back to them! Recycling fashion at its best. &nbsp;</p><p id=ec1yzktrctap data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Kate Middleton loves these affordable earrings - and you may already have them in your jewellery box</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
