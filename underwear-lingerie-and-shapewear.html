We, too, have a ton of questions. Do you need to pre-wash period underwear? Can you throw them in with your regular clothes? What about drying? Will putting them in the dryer ruin them or make them less effective?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With all this in mind, InStyle decided to reach out to a laundry care expert for help. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Tide</a> Senior Scientist, Sammy Wang, MSE, solved all our period underwear dilemmas ahead, from what to do after you're done wearing them to how to remove stains that won't budge.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-does-period-underwear-need-to-be-pre-washed></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Does period underwear need to be pre-washed?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Wang, before you throw your period underwear into your washing machine, you'll need to rinse them out first.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Always rinse period underwear in cold water after use until the water runs clear," she advises. "This helps to remove excess stains and prevent buildup."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once you've completed that first step, Wang tells us to hold off on throwing them in with the rest of your dirty clothes. "Be sure to let period underwear air dry completely before putting it into the hamper."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-should-you-wash-period-underwear-on-gentle></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Should you wash period underwear on gentle?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At this point, you likely know that it's recommended to wash everyday underwear on "delicate" or "gentle." But does that same rule apply to period underwear, which are heavily soiled? While Wang suggests looking on the manufacturer's site for specific care instructions and information, in general, yes, period underwear should still be washed as "delicates."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Because period underwear is designed to wick, absorb, and hold liquids, it is constructed of several different layers of fabrics with different properties. These layers and fabric types can vary between brands, but to keep the garment in good condition, treat period underwear as 'delicates' and wash them in mesh garment bags, cold water, and avoid high-temperature machine drying."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-temperature-should-you-use-when-washing-period-underwear></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What temperature should you use when washing period underwear?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As previously mentioned, period underwear should be washed with cold water.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Always check the instructions on the garment's care label first, but in general, it is best to wash in cold water with a stain and odor-fighting detergent like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Tide Ultra Oxi with Odor Eliminators</a>," Wang tells us. She adds that "cold water helps to preserve the layered fabrics that are used in period underwear to absorb and hold liquids," and that it also "helps to prevent staining."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-can-you-get-rid-of-period-blood-stains-that-havent-lifted></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How can you get rid of period blood stains that haven't lifted?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We recommend pre-treating blood stains with a stain-fighting liquid detergent like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Tide Ultra Stain Release</a>," says Wang. "High quality detergents like Tide contain specialized ingredients that help to break down protein-based stains and lift them away."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In order to effectively <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>remove blood stains</a> from your period underwear, Wang shared the below step-by-step instructions and tips.</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li>Rinse the stain with cold water until the water runs clear.</li><li>Apply a small amount of liquid detergent directly onto the stain and gently rub with a soft bristled toothbrush.</li><li>Let sit for 5-10 minutes before machine washing in cold with a stain and odor-fighting detergent like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Tide Ultra Oxi with Odor Eliminators Power PODs</a>.</li></ul><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-is-it-bad-to-let-period-underwear-sit-in-your-laundry-for-days></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Is it bad to let period underwear sit in your laundry for days?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In short, the answer is yes. It's important to rinse period underwear in cold water after wearing them, and continue rinsing until the water runs clear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"While this may be a little more work up front, this helps to prevent prolonged contact of stains with the fabric and helps prevent buildup over time," says Wang. "Always allow rinsed period underwear to air dry completely before putting it into the hamper. When you're ready to do a load of laundry, we recommend a stain and odor-fighting detergent like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Tide Ultra Oxi with Odor Eliminators Power PODs</a> that are designed for tough loads."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-best-ways-to-ensure-the-longevity-of-period-underwear></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What are the best ways to ensure the longevity of period underwear?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Period underwear tends to cost more than your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>regular old briefs and boy shorts</a>, so if you're shelling out money for a decent pair, you want to make sure it lasts longer than a few wears. This is why it's important to research the materials and the care instructions for different brands, ensuring you're washing your garments correctly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Because period underwear is designed to be both comfortable and absorbent, it is often constructed with several layers of fabrics like cotton, modal, spandex, nylon, and polyurethane," Wang tells us, before sharing Tide's recommendations on how to effectively wash and care for this specific combination of fabrics.</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li>Rinse in cold water until the water runs clear after every use — this helps to prevent set-in stains and buildup over time.</li><li>Wash in a mesh delicates bag to prevent snagging and help protect the layered construction of period underwear.</li><li>Wash in cold water with a high-quality detergent like T<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>ide Ultra Oxi with Odor Eliminators Power PODs</a>, which is designed to work on all types of fabrics and help fight stains and odors.</li><li>Avoid high-temperature machine drying and line dry if possible.</li><li>Because different brands use different fabrics and constructions, always refer to the garment's care label, but in general, we recommend rinsing in cold water after use and treating period underwear like "delicates".</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ykuM6tn6Kml2TCr7DEq66emaJiuaq6xp6pop1dlruledKhmKmdp5qus3vHqK5mrJ9ixKK%2Fx2annqqZpLFuwc2dnKuvlZa%2F</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./feid-set-to-bring-his-ferxxo-nitro-jam-underground-tour-to-the-us-and-canada.html><span>←</span><span>Feid Set to Bring His Ferxxo Nitro Jam Underground Tour to the US and Canada</span></a>
