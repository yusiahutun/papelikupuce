So when I stumbled upon a formula with a basically perfect score, I knew I had to investigate. The skin savior I’m talking about is the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Time-Filler 5-XP Cream</a>.</p><p>Laboratoires Filorga recently updated its best-selling Time-Filler formula to work even better on minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s the first time the brand has reformulated the O.G. Time-Filler since it launched a decade ago, so this is a big deal.&nbsp;</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p>The anti-aging essential now contains five types of expertise: expression lines, deep wrinkles, surface wrinkles, dehydration wrinkles, and neck wrinkles. How can a single <a href=# id=auto-tag_face-moisturizer data-tag=face-moisturizer>face moisturizer</a> address all of that? It’s simple—the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Time-Filler 5-XP Cream</a> contains encapsulated hyaluronic acid, tripeptide, sea fennel extract, and kangaroo paw flower extract. That’s an all-star lineup of ingredients if I’ve ever seen one.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/laboratoires-filorga-time-filler-5-xp-cream.png><p>To start, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>hyaluronic acid</a> is a godsend for retaining moisture since it can hold 1,000 times its weight in water, while tripeptide is packed with amino acids that firm the skin. On top of that, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>sea fennel extract</a> boosts the production of collagen and <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>kangaroo paw flower extract</a> hydrates, firms, and brightens. All of these ingredients contribute to the product’s anti-aging abilities. The brand calls attention to these four elements, but I took a look at the ingredient list and picked out a few more highlights: glycerin, squalane, and niacinamide.&nbsp;</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Dr. Shereene Idriss</a>, a board-certified dermatologist, the founder of Idriss Dermatology in New York City, and the creator of the #PillowtalkDerm series on Instagram, previously told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>StyleCaster</a> about the skin benefits of glycerin and explained that “It provides a holy trinity of benefits: it decelerates water loss while offering both skin penetration and retention properties in the dermis.”</p><p>As if that wasn’t enough, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">squalane</a> is great for soothing, softening, and hydrating skin, while <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>niacinamide</a> works to fade dark spots, hydrate, reduce acne and inflammation, and strengthen skin.</p><p>After reading about these ingredients’ laundry list of benefits, shoppers’ glowing reviews should come as no surprise.&nbsp;</p><p>“Wow, this is like a little pot of Miracles!!! The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">luxurious cream</a> has transformed my fine lines and has reduced them dramatically,” raved one happy reviewer. “I have found my holy grail product and won’t ever stop using it. I am a skincare blogger and tried all the top brands like Estée Lauder & Elemis, but this beats them all hands down! I’ve just got the new eye cream to review so can’t wait to try that next.”</p><p>Another one wrote, “I’ve only been using this for two weeks now but happy with how my face looks and feels. I’ve already noticed my deep forehead lines diminishing which bothers me the most. Cannot wait to see my results in a month or two and will update with photos.”</p><p>“I’m obsessed, my skin feels so hydrated. My wrinkles are reduced tremendously. I’ve bought the entire Time-Filler product line,” another shopper wrote.</p><p>If you’re hoping for results like these, apply the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Time-Filler 5-XP Cream</a> every day in the morning and night—and remember to show your neck some love, too.</p><p>Whether you have deep-set wrinkles or super fine lines coming in around your eyes, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this face moisturizer</a> is ready to get to work and yield amazing results. After all, it boasts a 4.9-star overall rating for a reason.</p><p>A ton of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Laboratoires Filorga’s other product offerings</a> have equally as impressive reviews.
