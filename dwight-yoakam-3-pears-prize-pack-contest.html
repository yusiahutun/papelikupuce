He's also included a snippet of another called 'Trying' on his <a href=#>official website</a>. <a href=#>Beck</a> helped produced two songs -- 'A Heart Like Mine' and 'Missing Heart' -- and <a href=#>Kid Rock</a> joined him for another. Yoakam said during a recent interview on <a href=#>Southern California Public Radio</a> that '3 Pears' would include a "Cowpunk" song, and that the title track was inspired by the <a href=#>Beatles</a> and the recent George Harrison documentary.</p><p>"And then one night [the Beatles] were in London, swinging London, just kind of knocking around and someone slipped them LSD and they don’t know where they were for a day and a half," he explains. "<a href=#>John Lennon</a> and George Harrison were somewhere all over London, and I thought ‘There must be funny Polaroids somewhere,’ and as I said that they cut to John and John was wearing these round, Italian, wrap-around, Mod Carnaby Street sunglasses -- a pair on his forehead, a pair on the bridge of his nose and a pair on his chin … And I thought what a tragic, tragic loss … and I got up and wrote the chorus, within a minute or two, of that song."</p><p>Sign up to win one of five copies of '3 Pears' or one of five prize packs, which include a CD and an autographed poster. Only one entry per person, please. This contest ends on Sept. 30 at 11:59PM ET.
