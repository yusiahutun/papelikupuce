Will the home-ground advantage tip the scales in their favor? Los Angeles, despite stumbling in the middle of March, rounded off the month on a high note with three consecutive victories on foreign soil.&nbsp;</p><p>They now have an opportunity to add another feather to their cap by winning at&nbsp;a venue where they enjoyed a 14-point victory earlier in the season. More often than not, the Clippers' success is driven by their third-highest offensive rating in the league.</p><p>The Clippers, backed by their third-best three-point shooting expertise, rank third in true shooting percentage. They are one of the teams heavily dependent on mid-range shots and stand fifth in midrange efficiency. Further, they are 12th in free throw attempts per game, fourth in free throw percentage, 15th in offensive rebounding percentage, and 15th in turnover percentage. Is it a ripe time for them to sustain the winning momentum? <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><strong>ALSO READ:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","LA Clippers Injury Report: Will Paul George Play Against Kings Tonight?
