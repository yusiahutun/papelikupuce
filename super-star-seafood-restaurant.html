Add to this friendly and helpful service, and you have a winning, although expensive, combination.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We were intrigued by the oddly named 'white broccoli' with garlic. It turned out to be plain old cauliflower, but whatever they call it, it is delicious. A whole head, cut in large pieces, is cooked al dente and covered with a light, simple sauce, crunchy and pungent with lots of minced fried garlic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We also liked the diced eggplant, quickly sauteed with minced beef and chillies, and wished only that it was a bigger portion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A combination plate of grilled eel, deep-fried bean curd and roast pork was wonderful, as was a dish of fresh assorted mushrooms and green beans. The waitress will probably recommend their 'award-winning' roast duck, but we do not find it that special, and there are many other dishes we'd rather try.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Portions are small and prices are expensive, but quality is high, and the menu offers some unusual dishes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">TONKICHI P412 World Trade Centre 280 Gloucester Road Causeway Bay Tel: 2577-6617 Open: noon-3pm, 6pm-10.30pm Do not even think of coming here if you do not like fried foods: you will not be eating much. This place specialises in tonkatsu - meat or seafood lightly breaded and deep-fried.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They cook it to perfection - none of that soggy, sorry mess often found at other places. The number of Japanese businessmen dining solo or in groups seems to be an endorsement of the quality of the food.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">You can try pork chops, oysters, prawns, potato or minced meat croquettes and combination platters - all beautifully fried so it is light and greaseless, and served in big portions. The fried food is accompanied by soup, rice, pickled vegetables and fresh fruit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The large dining room is spacious and airy, with tables set well apart.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If you want to get loud and raucous on the sake, there are some smaller private dining rooms. The waitresses are attentive and gracious, even when the restaurant is busy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdia312gZFoqq6olad6tMDAq2SsnZGbvLCwjKucrKyRqr%2BiutM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jonathan-van-ness-jvn-hair-interview.html><span>←</span><span>Jonathan Van Ness JVN Interview</span></a>
