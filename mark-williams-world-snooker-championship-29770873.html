The 48-year-old’s modest upbringing made him appreciate the importance of hard work, which has been keen to his success on the baize over the years.</p><p>"You see the struggles they have back in the day so you appreciate what you’ve got,” he told the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Telegraph.</a> “If I didn’t make it as a snooker player I’d have been a miner like my father and his father. That’s where everyone ended up. No work about.”</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Mark Selby gets lucky with 'bonkers' fluke that 'sounded like the cue had snapped'</a></b></p><p>His father was key to him avoiding a gruelling life down the pit, helping him bunk off school to hone his potting skills.</p><p>“He was the one who would pretend I was going to school and take me to the snooker. My mother thought I was in school,” he revealed. “He was the main one who took me to junior tournaments. All that petrol money. It was tough times for miners.”</p><p>Williams did sample his dad’s trade though – and it was an experience he would rather forget.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29770929.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS297348671.jpg><p>"I got snuck in with these 10 or 15 men – snuck in the middle – and down the lift,” he recalled. "It was horrific. The battery pack with a light on was nearly as heavy as me. Awful.</p><p>"I was glad to get back up. But I said to myself, ‘if I don’t make it in snooker this is where I’m going for 12 hours a day’."</p><p>Williams is renowned for his ability to deal with pressurised situations on the table and says that experience helped harden his mindset.</p><p><b><i>Who will win the World Snooker Championship?

I just don’t feel nervous or shake,” he explained. "When I missed a pink to win 18-15 against John Higgins [in the 2018 world final] I just missed it.</p><p>"I went back to my chair, said, ‘How the f--- did I miss that?’ Sat down, thought, ‘no problem’ and next frame, popped a nice red in the middle and made a frame-winning break.</p><p>"I love playing snooker. I’m competitive with everything. If I win, great. If I lose, shake hands and forget about it.
