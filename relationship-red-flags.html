I concur — as a perpetually caffeinated journalist living in New York City, the correct use of the word "you're" and an overpriced cup of coffee are basically my turn-ons. Don't even get me started on people who put pineapple on their pizza. Immediate swipe left.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jokes aside, there are some legitimate (and more valid) red flags that really shouldn't be ignored. Sure, maintaining any relationship requires compromise or sacrifice, but you should never give up your wants and needs or put your happiness at bay. When we're&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>newly in love</a>, relationship red flags can be notoriously easy to miss or ignore — although they're usually clear as day after the fact.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So we've tapped relationship experts Dr. Jessica January Behr, Logan Ury, and Susan Trombetti to help us out.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><ul><li>Jessica January Behr, Psy.D, is a licensed clinical psychologist and founder of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Behr Psychology</a>&nbsp;in New York City.</li><li>Logan Ury is a dating expert and Director of Relationship Science at&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Hinge</a>.</li><li>Susan Trombetti is a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>matchmaker</a>&nbsp;and the CEO of Exclusive Matchmaking.</li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for some common relationship red flags, plus advice for how to deal.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-red-flags></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are Red Flags?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you've ever played the game "Red Flag or Deal-Breaker" with friends, you know that some "red flags" are totally subjective. Most of the time, they're specific to each individual and their "values, desires, and preferences," according to Dr. Behr. (For example, not being religious may be a deal-breaker to one person and a total non-issue to another person.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also, what we consider to be a red flag can evolve.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"What is a red flag today might not be one tomorrow, and vice versa," Dr. Behr said before adding that "some common red flags that people report have to do with communication, values, and judgment."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sometimes, we get a warning sign — either by someone's words or actions — that they're not ready for a relationship or not ready for a relationship with&nbsp;you, noted Ury. However, depending on the person and the behavior, it could take one date or several years for that alarm bell to sound.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, it's totally common for us to miss these red flags when we're blinded by love.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"People can be emotionally charged and ignore the red flags in the beginning or find a way to deceive themselves to lessen the impact because sometimes they just don't want to face reality," explained Trombetti. "Other times, they just miss them if their picker is off or they lack boundaries."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sometimes, they only come into focus once the relationship is over.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You can clearly see them in hindsight, and lots of people [realize] the warnings were there," Trombetti added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Below are a few universal toxic behaviors in modern dating that relationship experts say should set off alarm bells. While some can be worked through with communication (depending on what they are and how you feel about them), others, like any kind of abuse, should be considered deal-breakers — aka exit the relationship as soon as possible.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>1. Love Bombing</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ury told us that one of the biggest relationship red flags she sees these days is "love bombing," which is when your partner becomes very invested early on. A form of manipulation, the love bomber will talk all about your future, shower you with affection and grandiose declarations of love, and get you to fall for them — only to pull away and leave you brokenhearted. Love bombing is most common among&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>narcissists</a>&nbsp;and goes hand-in-hand with other toxic relationship traits, including gaslighting and emotional abuse, so consider this one a dealbreaker.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>2. An Obsession with Social Media</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While media and social platforms have become heavily inundated in our day-to-day lives, Ury advised watching out if someone is a little&nbsp;too&nbsp;into their profile and following. She shared that 74 percent of Hinge users see this as a red flag since it can allude to the person being insecure or self-absorbed.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>3. Lack of Communication</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We all know that communication is a key pillar in any relationship. If your partner seems absent or like they're not listening to you while you're speaking or doesn't respond to your texts or messages, this is a sign that they are disconnected or distracted, said Dr. Behr. Step one: Have a conversation to see if your different communication styles can be worked through with a little patience and understanding.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>4. Controlling or Jealous Behavior</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some jealousy here and there can be harmless, and it is pretty common in a relationship. However, if your partner starts to become possessive or controlling of your plans, what you wear, who you hang out with, or isolates you from your friends and family, this can be a serious&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sign of emotional abuse</a>&nbsp;down the line, Trombetti suggested.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>5. Bad Relationships with Friends or Family</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Behr noted a lack of familial relationships or talking poorly about friends and family may be cause for concern, especially if these things are important to you. Ury recommended first giving them the benefit of the doubt and asking your partner why this is the case before considering it a deal-breaker.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Perhaps their upbringing made it hard for them to be close to their family, but they've worked hard to cultivate a strong 'chosen family' in their group of friends," said Ury.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>6. Extreme Emotional Reactions</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If someone displays unmanageable emotions and easily flies off the handle, this is a serious red flag. Responding with uncontrollable rage or the "silent treatment" could point to abusive (physical or emotional) behavior in the future, noted Trombetti. On the other hand, Trombetti added, a lack of empathy may mean they're void of emotion and care. In other words: You want someone whose emotions are in control and appropriate for the situation.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>7. Alcohol or Substance Abuse</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're dating someone who is often unable to handle their alcohol (and not just on one occasion), or they drink and use substances in excess, they could potentially have an addiction. The first step, in this case, is a serious conversation. If your partner has a binge drinking problem and refuses help, consider this a deal-breaker — it's like waiting for a time bomb to go off. On the other hand, if they can recognize the problem and get help, this could deepen your relationship.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>8. Gaslighting</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gaslighting is a hot topic in modern dating, so you've probably heard of it. Basically, it means they turn the blame on you for something they did or hold you responsible for the way they reacted to a situation.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's just a way to blow you up and make you think you are crazy," said Trombetti.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gaslighting is a form of manipulation meant to leave you feeling insecure and questioning your sanity, so trust your gut if something feels wrong and leave the relationship.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>9. Downright Abusive Behavior</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While some of the red flags above are considered types of emotional abuse, it bears repeating: If anyone verbally, emotionally, physically, or sexually abuses you or puts you in harm's way, get out as soon as possible and receive any necessary help — full stop, Dr. Behr advised. "These are the types of red flags that should not be resolved in the context of a relationship. If you are in harm's way, it is not a red flag; it is a stop sign," Dr. Behr said.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-handle-relationship-red-flags></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Handle Relationship Red Flags</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As mentioned above, if your partner is&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>abusive&nbsp;</a>in any way or puts you in danger, Dr. Behr strongly urged you to end the relationship. That is your sign to get out now. With some of the less severe red flags, it can be hard to know whether or not you should address it with your partner or just run. Experts suggested a few steps to take to assess whether or not this is something that can be worked through.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Never Ignore</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you notice something that is wrong or even makes you feel a certain way, all the experts agreed: Do not ignore it. It's your mind's way of flagging the issue.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Signs need to be interpreted," explained Dr. Behr.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_80-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's easier said than done, of course. Sometimes, we ignore red flags in a relationship because we really want it to work this time, or perhaps you're so caught up in the relationship that you let them slip by, noted Ury.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_82-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They're an opportunity to pause, assess the situation, and decide if you should continue investing time in this person," Trombetti added.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_84-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Check-In with Yourself</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_85-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once you've identified an action or behavior as a red flag, it's time to do some inner reflection. Of course, you shouldn't compromise on your needs, but there's also the possibility you're being too harsh on your partner.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_87-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Take a moment and ask yourself, 'Am I being too judgmental, or is this a genuine issue?'" said Ury.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_91-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Talk It Out</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_92-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If the issue at hand is still worrisome to you, it's time to communicate with your partner.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_94-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Let your partner know if their behavior or emotion is unacceptable and unsustainable for you and why," said Dr. Behr, noting that your partner could just be "unaware of how their words or actions affect others" and not ill-intended.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_96-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Other times, we misinterpret somebody's words or behaviors based on our own past life experiences.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_98-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Asking questions and sharing your own experience can help," said Dr. Behr. "Sharing your own vulnerability and interpretations can help your partner to learn about you and present themselves in a more accurate way."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_100-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Behr also noted that we all have different love languages, and your partner may not be used to showing love the way you need. The only way to work through the disconnect is by being upfront and asking for what you need.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_102-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Through communicating, you may be able to find new understanding, tolerance, or acceptance of the former red flag that allows the relationship to continue and even grow," said Dr. Behr.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_104-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Again, abuse is an automatic deal-breaker and does not require any communication.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_106-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Don't Settle</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_107-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If something "disturbs your peace enough to change your behavior," you may want to consider ending the partnership.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_109-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you have communicated, shared your vulnerability, and asked for what you needed and the behavior or feeling has not changed, it may be that you and this individual aren't compatible at this time," suggested Dr. Behr.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_111-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Behr also noted that it may be better to cut your losses and look elsewhere if you're not super invested, adding that a red flag just means that you and the other person are not compatible, and that's totally OK!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-identify-red-flags></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_113-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Identify Red Flags</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_114-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, we often notice red flags&nbsp;after&nbsp;the love-spell fog of a new relationship wears off. How many times have you easily spotted a red flag once the relationship was over? (For me, more than I'd like to admit.) If you relate to this, there are a few ways that you can improve your red flag radar.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_116-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ury suggested making a list of common red flags you've come across in the past, especially if you're someone who tends to overlook them. The next time you spot that same characteristic in a potential partner, Ury said to "run in the opposite direction." The sooner you spot a red flag, the more time you'll save both parties, noted Ury. Remember, relationships are a learning experience, so take anything you discover from one and apply it to the next.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-bottom-line></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_118-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Bottom Line</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_119-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you spot a relationship red flag, don't ignore it and hope it goes away on its own. Face it head-on by asking yourself why it bothers you, communicating your concerns to your partner, and either working through it or ending the relationship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_121-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, call the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>National Domestic Violence Hotline</a> at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9Geo5qsmaS7tLTIqWSrnZRis62txqw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zim-opens-new-shekou-service.html><span>←</span><span>Zim opens new Shekou service</span></a>
