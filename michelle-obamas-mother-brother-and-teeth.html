She is undoubtedly one of the most popular and influential women in the United States of America and the world as a whole there is also no doubt that you have read tons of articles about the type of person she is her journey and the rest of it are highlighted.</p><p>So today let’s shift the focus from the former First Lady of the United States to Michelle Obama’s mother her brother and oddly enough her teeth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Michelle Obama’s Mother</strong></h2><p>Marian is popularly known as the “First Grandma” and some of you may don’t know this but she lived in the White House with the former First family throughout her tenure. She was the first living grandmother there since Elivera M. Doud the mother of Mamie Eisenhower during the Eisenhower government.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Michelle-Obama’s-Mother-1-640x427.jpg><p>Her name is Marian Lois Robinson but she was born on 30 July 1937 in Chicago as Marian Shields. She was a large family when she was the fourth of seven children; five girls and two boys born of Purnell Nathaniel Shields a house painter and his wife Rebecca Jumper a licensed practical nurse.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ:&nbsp;<a title="Princess Diana’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements" href=# rel=bookmark>Princess Diana’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Michelle-Obama’s-Mother-3.jpeg><p>She married Michelle’s father Fraser Robinson on 27 October 1960 in Chicago where they both had extended families. Unfortunately, he died on March 6, 1991. Besides the fact that she is Michelle Obama’s mother, Marian became popular when she became the living grandmother in the White House.</p><p>She lived on the third floor of the White House and although she works behind the scenes her presence is critical to the well-being of the first family. She was recruited for the job of a parental deputy from Malia then 10 and Sasha 7 while her parents took care of the needs of the entire nation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Michelle-Obama’s-Mother.jpg><p>Michelle Obama’s mother was an integral part of the first family and worked from the shadows to ensure that the Obamas represented America to the best of their ability.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Brother</strong></h2><p>As most of you already know she is not an only child nor is she the first. The former FLOTUS has a brother who is 22 months older than her. Michelle may have a lot of achievements to her name but it’s best to believe that her big brother isn’t limper either both Robinson’s children are very successful in their fields.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Michelle-Obama’s-Mother-4.jpg><p>He was born Craig Malcolm Robinson on April 21 1962 in Deyoung Illinois. He was a gifted child when he learned to read at the age of four he was even allowed to skip 2nd grade and beyond that, he graduated from high school as a class graduate. He was a star striker as a player at Princeton University in the early 1980s and a pension dealer in the 1990s.</p><p>Today he is vice president of player and organizational development for the Milwaukee Bucks. He also coaches and broadcasts television. Craig is currently on marriage number two until 2000 he was in divorce from his first wife with whom he had two children: Avery and Leslie. In 2006 he was remarried and had two sons Austin and Aaron with his wife Kelly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Michelle-Obama-Young.jpg><p><strong>ALSO READ:&nbsp;<a title="Abraham Lincoln’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements" href=# rel=bookmark>Abraham Lincoln’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Michelle Obama’s Teeth</strong></h2><p>It’s a little sad that this is a problem. Yes, the former First Lady of the United States of America doesn’t have the best teeth out there; after some, she has an overbite and an underbite. A handful of people have wondered why she has never used the unlimited human and monetary resources to which she has had and still has access.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Michelle-Obama’s-Brother.jpg><p>Well here’s a picture of someone who has the same dental problems as the former First Lady.</p><p>I have a very similar underbite to her own. It is a mild class 3 bite (not serious/life-threatening!) and several orthodontists I have consulted have confirmed that wearing braces can help but will not solve the skeletal problem.</p><p>Performing a maxillofacial operation is the only way to reduce the protruding jaw. In the case of the First Lady or in my case because the condition is so mild however surgery is not recommendable/valuable as it is associated with significant risks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Michelle-Obama’s-Teeth.jpg><p>‘And this can be seen by some as a cosmetic surgery rather than medical (this will give the public/media a bad and misleading image). Sensory nerves can be damaged leading to permanent loss of senses in the lower half of the face…not to mention other complications that may occur.</p><p>So there we have it that’s all we could gather about Michelle Obama’s mother her brother and her teeth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Career in Lawyer and Public Service</strong></h2><p>Following the completion of her law degree in 1988, Michelle Obama began working as an associate for Sidley Austin’s Chicago office focusing on marketing and intellectual property. She has been a valuable asset to the firm since then, providing expertise in these areas.</p><p>In 1991, she made the transition from corporate law to public service, taking on roles as an assistant to Mayor Richard Daley and then serving as the assistant commissioner of planning and development for Chicago.</p><p>In 1993, Michelle was appointed as the executive director of Public Allies Chicago, an organization that provides leadership training to young adults and equips them with the necessary skills for successful careers in public service.</p><p>In 1996, Michelle started her career at the University of Chicago as Associate Dean of Student Services and established the institution’s inaugural community service program. Subsequently, from 2002 onwards she held a position at the University of Chicago Hospitals as Executive Director for Community Relations and External Affairs.</p><p>In May 2005, Michelle was selected to take on the role of Vice President for Community and External Affairs at the University of Chicago Medical Center. She maintained this position part-time until shortly before her husband’s inauguration as president. Additionally, she held a board member with the well-regarded Chicago Council on Global Affairs.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><b>Quick Facts</b></h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=24><tr><td colspan=2><strong>Bio</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Real Name</td><td>Michelle Obama</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nickname</td><td>Miche, The First Lady, Mrs. Robinson, My Rock (Barack Obama calls her so)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Profession</td><td>American lawyer and writer</td></tr><tr><td>Party</td><td>Democratic</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><strong>Physical Stats & More</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Height</td><td>in centimeters-&nbsp;<strong>180 cm</strong><br>in meters-&nbsp;<strong>1.80 m</strong><br>in Feet Inches-&nbsp;<strong>5’ 11”</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms-&nbsp;<strong>68 kg</strong><br>in Pounds-&nbsp;<strong>150 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Eye Colour</td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Colour</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><strong>Personal Life</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Date of Birth</td><td>January 17, 1964</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as in 2017)</td><td><strong>53 Years</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>DeYoung, Illinois, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Zodiac sign/Sun sign</td><td>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Hometown</td><td>Illinois, USA</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>School</td><td>Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy),<br>Chicago, Illinois, USA<br>Whitney M.
