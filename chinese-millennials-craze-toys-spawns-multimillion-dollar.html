The market for blind boxes could grow to 25 billion yuan (US$3.8 billion) in 2025 from about 3 billion yuan in 2019, according to Shenzhen-based consultancy Qianzhan Intelligence. The craze, though, has attracted stinging criticism last month from several state-run media outlets, which likened it to gambling addiction.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2019/07/18/claw_thumbnail1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:01</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">China’s ‘biggest’ crane game centre gets customers digging out plush versions of popular online characters</p><p>China’s ‘biggest’ crane game centre gets customers digging out plush versions of popular online characters</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Buyers of blind boxes do not know which figurine they will get until they unpack them. Some may get the thrill of winning sought-after characters, some may be frustrated with ones they already have. Getting the desired piece to complete a collection depends entirely on luck, or perhaps on the amount of money spent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is like a jackpot when I finally unveiled the limited edition item,” said Sun, who has since spent some 10,000 yuan on other toy series over past six months. “Not knowing what I can get brings extra joy. Who said grown-ups cannot play with toys?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Retailers typically market them in trunks of 12 boxes, each in turn containing 12 blind boxes. Each trunk of 144 blind boxes may contain one or more limited-edition figurines, the most sought-after item in a series of characters or toys. It may not contain any at all, leaving everything to chance. Producers will never promise any special items in any trunk, according to Miniso Group.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The craze is not new. Some countries including Belgium have banned the controversial gaming feature known as “loot boxes”, where players are forced to make purchases without knowing the odds of getting a valuable or useful item.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The concept that is becoming wildly popular in China has similarities to Japan’s Gashapon vending machines from 60 years ago, which dispensed capsule toys. China’s toymakers are betting on the country’s 500 million millennials and members of generation Z, who are flush with disposable income and willing to spend on such indulgences.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2019/07/18/claw_thumbnail1.jpg><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Pop Mart International</span></a>, widely regarded as the creator of the craze in China, has enamoured investors with its recent success. The company’s shares closed at HK$81.35 on December 31, more than doubling within 20 days of listing in Hong Kong.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We certainly did not expect such an enthusiastic response [to Pop Mart’s shares],” said Kenny Wen, wealth management strategist at Everbright Sun Hung Kai in Hong Kong. “The purchasing power for cute toys and the chase for limited editions is insanely huge, beyond our imagination.”</p>The <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">15-to-35-year age group ﻿is Pop Mart’s target segment</span></a> as these consumers have a solid financial foundation thanks to their parents, Wang Ning, founder and CEO of Pop Mart, told the Post. “They pay for the self-expression, companionship and playfulness these toys can offer easily.”On <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Tmall</span></a>, some 200,000 consumers traded blind boxes on the site, spending 20,000 yuan each on average, according to a report issued in 2019 by the online platform. The collection of figurines has overtaken trendy trainers and video games as the most popular hobby among consumers born after 1995, the report added.The shopping binge has drawn more players, such as New York-listed Chinese variety lifestyle goods retailer <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Miniso</span></a> to join the game.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/01/06/9e36978c-4b47-11eb-9c55-93e83087d811_1320x770_172358.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Miniso, which used to retail toys for children, saw sales of the blind box figurines increase 10 per cent month on month since it launched the business last year, with sales totalling 25 million yuan by November.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The “satisfactory” sales resulted in the kick-off of Top Toy on December 18, which focuses on selling blind box toys and other art toys, setting it apart from its flagship Miniso variety stores.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The fever has spread to other areas. Museums, coffee brewer Starbucks, convenience store FamilyMart and even e-commerce giant Tencent Holdings have either offered their own blind box toys or collaborated with toymakers to harness the rising consumption power.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The British Museum even set up a pop-up store in Shanghai in July, selling a range of Egyptian god figurines in blind boxes while HKRI Taikoo Hui shopping centre rolled out an outdoor carnival surrounded by giant figures representing the most significant Japanese blind box art toy Sonny Angel during Christmas to attract foot traffic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Every one is trying to participate in the ‘blind box’ party,” said Pedro Yip, partner in Oliver Wyman’s retail and consumer goods practice. “It is probably the best tool to woo young Chinese spenders who, unlike previous generations [who] might have suffered from poverty and unstableness, like adventure and [want to] explore unknown things.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, market observers have concerns whether the trend is sustainable. “The overspend and speculation in particular is clearly not what the central government is fond of. The biggest risk [of the business] lies in the possible tightened regulation,” said Everbright’s Wen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">More than 400,000 such boxes were traded on Alibaba Group’s Xianyu online flea market in 2020 and some rare versions, originally bought for some 40 or 50 yuan, can sell for several hundred US dollars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/01/06/cc0c55b6-4b79-11eb-9c55-93e83087d811_1320x770_172358.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Some hope to make a fortune overnight from getting rare figures,” said Zhang Xingshui, a lawyer with Beijing Kingdom Law Firm. “The irrational thought is partially the buyers’ fault and also due to the exaggerated marketing by unknown speculators.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The lawyer said that his firm received many legal inquiries last year. In one example, parents of a university student came for help as their son spent all of his tuition fee and money to support his campus life, some 30,000 yuan, on buying blind boxes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Blind box toys are good to play with and collect, but more regulations should be imposed to curb the emerging speculations,” said Zhang.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: End may be in sight for ‘blind box’ toy craze as industry collects billions</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtfmLWqusBmma6rmaOytL%2BOmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkGptaWxiZLCptc2eqp5lnZ65rbHNp6CapKNisLOt2Z5kraepqHq0vMCwpaxlnaq5tbXMoqOloZ%2BjeqW7y6WYqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./china-property-developer-fantasia-faces-key-shareholder-revolt-debt-restructuring-plan.html><span>←</span><span>China property developer Fantasia faces key shareholder revolt on debt restructuring plan</span></a>
