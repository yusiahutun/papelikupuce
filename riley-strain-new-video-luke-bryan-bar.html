Strain is seen running east on Church St. when he trips and falls near a cement-encased traffic pole.</p><p>He's very slow to get up from that fall, and when the video switches to a second camera angle, he's seen holding his head. That's just before he enters the intersection at 1st and Gay; the closed road signs can be spotted at the very end of this second video.</p><p>Strain's&nbsp;fall led to an abrupt change in his pace as he walked east. The new video also shows where he came from and serves as indication that he may have been lost.</p><p>Luke's 32 Bridge is on Broadway and 3rd Ave., meaning Strain likely walked north along 3rd Ave before turning right on Church. His hotel was the Tempo by Hilton, on 8th and Commerce. That's west of downtown Nashville (about six blocks from 32 Bridge).</p><p>Talking to <a href=#>WKRN-TV</a>,&nbsp;Strain's father Chris&nbsp;says the family felt he may have been confused after exiting 32 Bridge. His group of fraternity brothers had been to several bars.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>Map from 32 Bridge to Tempo Hotel Nashville</span></p>Google Maps<p>loading...</p></figure><p>Billboards are up around Nashville seeking information about Strain's whereabouts. He was in town for a private event, at one time described as a fraternity conference.</p><p>Anyone with information can call 615-862-8600.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>R.I.P.: 40 Country Singers and Songwriters Who Died Too Soon</h2><p>These country singers had so much more to give.
