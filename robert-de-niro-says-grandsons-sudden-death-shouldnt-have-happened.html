The teenager died suddenly last summer, and the star is speaking out over the tragedy.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>movie</a> star suffered a tragedy last August when <a href=#>Leandro De Niro Rodriguez</a>, the only son of his daughter, passed away in New York City. The <a href=#>celebrity</a> has admitted it’s been playing on his mind ever since the family were rocked by the news. Robert De Niro called the death of his grandson a ‘shock’ in a new interview.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robert-de-niro-never-thought-his-grandson-would-die-in-shocking-tragedy>Robert De Niro ‘never thought’ his grandson would die in shocking tragedy</h2><p>The Killers of the Flower Moon actor spoke to People about what his family went through last year.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a> he was struck with “disbelief” when he was told.</p><p>“It’s just a shock,” he added. “I never thought it would happen.”</p><p>“And I just then started thinking about all the things I could have, should have done maybe with him,” Robert De Niro, who has seven children and 4 grandchildren including his grandson, continued.</p><p>“I don’t know if that would’ve made a different. And so that’s always playing on my mind”.</p><p>The 80-year-old then said it “shouldn’t have happened”.</p><p>Leandro, who was 19 at the time of his death, died from “toxic effects of fentanyl, bromazolam, alprazolam, 7-aminoclonazepam, ketamine and cocaine”, a medical report stated a month later.</p><p>Two weeks after he died, Sophia Marks was arrested in connection to the death. The 21-year-old was charged with one count of distributing and possessing with intent to distribute fentanyl and alprazolam. The New York native was also charged with two counts of distributing and possessing with intent to distribute fentanyl. Each of the charges carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in jail.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24>U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement at the time, Marks sold “fake oxycodone pills that contained fentanyl.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26>“At least one of Marks’s counterfeit pills was purchased and taken by a teenager, who subsequently died of a suspected overdose. The arrest was critical because, as we allege, Marks knew the pills could kill, and she continued selling them anyway,” he added. But he did not mention Robert De Niro’s grandson by name.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-you-were-so-deeply-loved>‘You were so deeply loved’</h2><p>Robert De Niro’s daughter Drena posted a tribute to his grandson, her only son, after the tragic news.</p><p>At the time the 55-year-old said he was: “My beautiful sweet angel. I have loved you beyond words or description from the moment I felt you in my belly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4>“You have been my joy, my heart and all that was ever pure and real in my life. I wish I was with you right now. I wish I was with you. I don’t know how to live without you but I’ll try to go on and spread the love and light that you so made me feel in getting to be your mama. You were so deeply loved and appreciated and I wish that love alone could have saved you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6>“I’m so sorry my baby.”</p><p>Loved ones and fellow celebrity stars sent prayers to the family.</p><p>Lenny Kravitz wrote: “Dearest Drena, sending my deepest condolences to you and the family. This is all beyond words at the moment. I love you.”</p><p>Rosie Brooklyn added: “Shocked! I’m so sorry! We are all here for you! I love you too much!”</p><p>And Andy Cohen echoed: “Drena I am so sad to hear about beautiful Leo. Sending you all my love ❤️”</p><p><strong>If you’ve been affected by this story, you can contact American Addiction Centers on (877) 686-7688.
