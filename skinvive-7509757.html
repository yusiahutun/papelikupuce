And while many of them can get repetitive in their claims —&nbsp;a lot of them "filling," or adding volume to, skin with hyaluronic acid, just in different areas of the face — the latest arrival is promising something a little more interesting. SkinVive, the latest debut from Juvéderm, is taking hyaluronic acid-based fillers in another direction.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike its peers, the goal of SkinVive, which received FDA approval in May, is to hydrate skin, versus plump it. It's been a long time coming, says David Kim, MD. "These fillers have been available in other markets, like Europe and Asia, for several years now, so it's nice to finally have it in the United States," he says. It's currently making its way into providers' hands, but in the meantime, here's what you need to know about it.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-skinvive></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is SkinVive?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">SkinVive is an injectable that uses microdroplets of hyaluronic acid, which — for the uninitiated — is the humectant known for its ability to draw and retain moisture in skin. It's "designed to improve skin smoothness and hydration of the cheek area, creating a radiant appearance that lasts for six months," says Melanie Palm, MD.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In clinical trials, it showed improvements in skin hydration, texture, and radiance. All told, it's a good option for those who are looking for improvements in the quality of their skin, she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-makes-it-different></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Makes It Different</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While dermal fillers are typically uses to augment, or "fill," various areas of the face, they can only do so much — and don't really impact the quality of the skin itself so much as its shape. With SkinVive, however, "microdroplets of hyaluronic acid can be placed superficially to hydrate the skin so it appears plump and glowy," says Dr. Kim. "Other dermal fillers are used primarily to contour the face and restore volume. These fillers don't improve the superficial layer of the skin."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's a good chance you'll find the two paired together, however. While it hasn't been studied for use in this regard (yet), "in my clinical practice, I expect that this unique hyaluronic acid product will be used as part of a comprehensive skin and facial treatment plan," says Dr. Palm.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-skinvive-works></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How SkinVive Works</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">SkinVive is a gel, and, as with other hyaluronic acid-based fillers, it'll be injected beneath your skin. (However, it'll likely be more superficial than typical dermal fillers, since it's designed to benefit skin at the surface.) Once in your skin it can "increase expression of aquaporin, a hydration marker that facilitates the flow of water into and out of cells, which may signal an increase in skin hydration."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In other words, it serves as the most powerful (and long-lasting) hyaluronic acid serum of your life. "Anyone who wants their skin to appear hydrated, supple, plump, and super-moisturized will benefit from this filler," says Dr. Kim. "This filler won't change the shape of your face so it won't change anyone's face — it's purely for hydration."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-results-of-skinvive></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Results of SkinVive</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The results are already impressive, especially when it comes to skin texture. "The majority of participants saw improvement in skin smoothness one month after receiving treatment, with results lasting through six months," says Dr. Palm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Clinical testing also saw an increase in patients who were satisfied with the level of skin radiance, as well as how refreshed skin looked versus how it appeared before the treatment.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-side-effects-and-downtime></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Side Effects and Downtime</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As with any cosmetic procedures, side effects happen. These "may include redness, bumps, swelling, bruising, tenderness, firmness, discoloration, and itching at the injection site," says Dr. Palm, who notes that they're typically mild (if they happen at all) and won't throw a wrench into everyday activities.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And, as for downtime, there's little to none: In clinical studies, patients went back to their daily activities immediately after treatment. However, it's always a good idea to avoid strenuous exercise, makeup, and sun exposure for the first 24 hours after treatment, she says.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570qSgp66Zq7Jug5RpcHBtZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./former-boston-drummer-sib-hashian-dies-during-concert-cruise.html><span>←</span><span>Former Boston Drummer Sib Hashian Dies During Concert Cruise</span></a>
