So her fans also want to learn more about her brother. This article is about his age, job, and his girlfriend.</p><p>So, keep scrolling down and read all about him here.</p><h3><strong>Meet Jake Blanchard, Avery Cyrus Brother</strong></h3><p>The very first post that Avery Cyrus has on her Instagram is of her and her brother Jake Blanchard. In December 2018, she posted another pic announcing that her brother had gotten big. She posted, “<span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">Lil bro not so little anymore.”</span></p><p>Avery has nearly 8 million followers on TikTok. Avery has established herself on the app as a well-known creator in the LGBTQ+ community since starting her account in July 2019. “My pride is how I’ve learned to be super comfortable in my own skin because growing up, I was weird and gay and super tomboyish,” she said in an interview with&nbsp;LATV Queer.</p><p>Avery speaks openly about her sexuality, relationships, and emotions on her platform. She also emphasizes other local creators for TikTok users to check out and follow. She also publishes entertaining challenges, dance videos, and lip-sync videos with her friends. Her “Baby Skateboard” video was the first to go viral in July 2021, in actuality.</p><p>In September 2022, Avery and Jojo went public with their relationship. In a TikTok video posted on September 13 that featured the two sharing a kiss in a Chuck E. Cheese photo booth, Avery and JoJo declared their romance official. The pair made their red carpet appearance two days later. The two initially fueled relationship speculations after they collaborated on a TikTok video on August 5. The two were seen mouthing the dialogue to a voiceover by Scott Disick and Kourtney Kardashian, a former couple.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We’re friends,” lip-synced JoJo. “Purely platonic,” mouthed Avery — prompting Jojo to laugh. Avery and Jojo continued to appear in each other’s social media posts in the weeks that followed — while also leaving flirty messages in each other’s comment sections.</p><p>JoJo said in a post-AGT interview that she has known Avery for months, despite the fact that the two only recently acknowledged their relationship in September.</p><p>“Avery has been a really good friend of mine for like six months now,” JoJo said in late August. “She’s awesome, she’s literally like the coolest and I’m really grateful to have her in my life. She’s a really, really good friend.”</p><p>The couple announced their love on their individual TikTok accounts and at red-carpet events after making Instagram official in September 2022. Sadly, the relationship was short-lived, as they publicly broke up in December 2022. Although their breakup first appeared amicable, JoJo suggested that Avery had other reasons for dating the “Boomerang” singer.</p><p>JoJo takes the opportunity to talk about her love life after coming out to her fans. She shared a TikTok in the fall of 2022 on their first trip to Chuck E. Cheese. She then shared an Instagram slideshow of her family’s Disney World vacation. After dating JoJo for a month, Avery asked her to be her girlfriend in a slide. JoJo and Avery reaffirmed their romance in a YouTube video after making it public, where JoJo expressed that they “really, really like each other.”</p><p>As a result, many people were shocked when they announced their split just a few months later.</p><p>According to J-14 magazine, on December 17, Avery shared a TikTok of her and JoJo on a cruise with their mutual pals. This is my ‘I’m sorry for breaking up with you’ present”&nbsp;JoJo said in the video as she made an appearance with a present for Avery. Avery then hinted that all was alright between her and JoJo by commenting on the video that they were “better as friends.” JoJo later made it appear as though things between her and Avery were everything but perfect.</p><h3><strong>Jake Blanchard Age</strong></h3><p>In 2023, Jake Blanchard is above 19 years old.</p><h3><strong>Jake Blanchard Job</strong></h3><p>Jake Blanchard is a social media influencer by profession.
