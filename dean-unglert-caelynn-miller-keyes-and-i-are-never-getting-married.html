We joke around about it. Just try to keep expectations to a minimum, you know? Like I said on the show, underpromise, overdeliver.”</p><p>He also added that Caelynn, 24, isn’t the one who changed him; in fact, he was ready to do so for himself.</p><p>“I think that I’ve just sort of gotten to a point where I’m willing to change and ready to change myself,” the California native added. “Obviously, it’s just nice to have someone that kind of come along and complement everything in each other’s lives that’s going on.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Dean-Unglert-Says-He-and-Caelynn-Miller-Keyes-Will-Never-Get-Married.jpg><p>Last month, the former Miss North Carolina USA opened up with Us about teasing him constantly about putting a ring on her finger. “<a href=#>Maybe that’s in our future</a>, but it would be way down our future,” she told Us on November 18.</p><p>Unglert first appeared on season 14 of <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>, vying for<a href=#><strong> Rachel Lindsay</strong></a>‘s heart. He went on to appear in season 4 of <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> then on <a href=#>The Bachelor Winter Games</a>.

I remember when I was a teenager, I was always so dead-set on having kids, but the world’s in flux. I don’t know if it’s necessarily the most responsible thing to do to bring a child into this world,” he shared with Us. “That being said, she wants kids, so I don’t know. I don’t know if I don’t want kids just because she wants kids, and I don’t want to get married just because she wants to get married.”</p><p>With reporting by Emily Marcus</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadnZGjera6xqWcq6xdmK6muNinpWalmaG5pr6MpJyynaNirq%2BwjKJkmqqVYrumwsSrZKCdpKm2r7OMppirqpmasXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./coco-lees-final-message-took-life-revealed-html.html><span>←</span><span>Coco Lee's 'final message before she took her own life is revealed'</span></a>
