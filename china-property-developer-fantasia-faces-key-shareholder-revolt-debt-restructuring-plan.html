TCL is seeking equitable treatment between minority investors and the controlling shareholder, one of the people said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong-listed Fantasia needs to hold a shareholder meeting to decide on the issuance of shares for the proposed debt swap, with support from at least 50 per cent of voting shareholders required. TCL, which has a 17.5 per cent shareholding, may vote against the issuance of new shares if current negotiations sour, said one of the people. It remains unclear when any shareholder meeting would take place.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fantasia said in a response to Bloomberg that if TCL opposes the proposal, the restructuring efforts may fail, and in the worst-case scenario, shareholders would get zero recovery. TCL Industries did not respond to an email seeking comment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/12/87fcad80-a72f-4d1c-86e8-2c76bed2c633_7bb5c3bc.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fantasia has already secured creditors’ support for its debt restructuring, meaning that any disruption at this stage could undermine an already advanced process. More broadly, the development highlights the clout that key shareholders may have as equity becomes a popular element in Chinese defaulters’ restructuring plans. Risks are already rising for weaker developers in the stock market, where financial strains are threatening the listing status for some.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After a 15-month wait, Fantasia revealed in January a restructuring blueprint that seeks to swap US$1.3 billion of offshore borrowings into shares and extend some debt. If implemented, the plan would result in offshore creditors collectively owning 52.6 per cent of the new Fantasia. TCL would be left with merely 1 per cent, and other minority shareholders with just 1.4 per cent.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Chinese developer Fantasia proposes US$4 billion debt swap to fix defaults</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fantasia, which is based in the southern coastal province of Guangdong and is controlled by founder Zeng Jie, became a defaulter in October 2021. The controlling shareholder would hold at least a 45 per cent equity interest after the restructuring, based on the current plan, down from 57.4 per cent as of the end of June 2021, according to the latest data available.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Any vote may hinge on how rules concerning the controlling shareholder are applied. The Hong Kong exchange requires any shareholder and his or her close associates to abstain from voting if such a shareholder has a material interest in a transaction. In the event that Fantasia’s controlling shareholder isn’t allowed to vote, it would remove a major obstacle for TCL to attempt to block the share issuance plan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fantasia intended to offer a revised plan, leaving minority shareholders more equity stake post-restructuring, but TCL did not agree to the details, according to people familiar with the discussions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Needing to get shareholder approval to issue shares for any debt swap “does put some leverage in the hands of existing shareholders but only so much,” said Daniel Margulies, a partner at Dechert LLP who specializes in restructuring matters in Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To some, preserving a founder’s control of a company is key to maintaining normal business operations after suffering a delinquency.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The controlling shareholder will remain the largest individual shareholder, so they have a vested interest in continuing to guide the company and that interests are aligned,” said Brandon Gale, head of Asia restructuring at Houlihan Lokey, which acts as financial adviser to Fantasia on its restructuring. Gale was speaking at a recent press event.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtfl66vt8innmaemaOur6%2FEaJirrJmYuaZ7kmtpaWppbHyktMinmGaooqS9pr7TsmSdnaaaubC8xKtkn5meqa60tcBmnZqblah6rLHYZqqhmaKatbC4w56pZqqVq7ytwIydnJusXaeytMDRrpqtraKeu6h5z6WYpw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wife-arrested-murder-husband-funeral-home-employee-spots-stab-wounds-police-missed-html.html><span>←</span><span>Wife arrested for murder of husband after funeral home employee spots stab wounds police missed</span></a>
