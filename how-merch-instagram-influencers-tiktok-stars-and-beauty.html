Here are but a few examples. Cult fashion watchdog Instagram account @<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">diet_prada</span></a> slings regular drops of merchandise, including hats, T-shirts, key rings and that ultimate merchandise accoutrement, the tote bag. As does celebrity gossip account @deuxmoi, which publishes unverified and thus often juicy celebrity titbits.Then there’s Christina Najjar, better known as Tinx, who has more than 1.2 million followers on <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">TikTok</span></a> (and 436,000 on Instagram) for her pop culture takes, recommendations and her “Rich Mom” series.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In February, Najjar launched a series of sweatshirts with Rich Mom printed on the front. She said on Instagram at the time, “Rich Mom Gear Vol 1. I can’t believe it’s finally here! I took my sweet time making this first drop because I wanted it to be a brand and not just a random T-shirt with Tinx on it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/24/890680c3-6f0f-4e5f-877c-582c2c5d5989_82832968.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I wanted to give you guys a cool piece of clothing that would mean something for years to come. That represented our relationship … and that represented you guys! The most fun, irreverent, smart, cool group of people I’ve ever known. I wanted to make something that you’d be proud to wear over sweatpants and low dunks or over jeans and boots.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other outlets tapping into the cultural zeitgeist include the fashion and pop culture Instagram account and podcast Every Outfit on Sex and the City.</p>The account’s founders, Lauren Garroni and Chelsea Fairless, sporadically create merchandise projects (and have written a book). This has included a T-shirt with the phrase “We Should all Be Mirandas”, a play on Dior’s “We Should All Be Feminists” T-shirt from creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri’s first collection <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">for the house</span></a>.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/24/fa8e227f-55cc-47b9-82b1-67fdf7feab59_f175ae64.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The phrase reflects one of the podcast’s central theses, and the one many of its fans now subscribe to: that Miranda Hobbes esq. was the real star of the cult series Sex and the City.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Proceeds from this particular shirt benefited The California Women’s Law Centre and Cynthia Nixon’s (the actress who played Miranda) 2018 campaign for New York governor.</p>It’s not just cult social media accounts and podcasts, either. <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Millennial mega-beauty start-up Glossier</span></a> has had some of the shine taken off its July 2021 valuation of US$1.8 billion with recent news of lay-offs, “mistakes”, and TikTok “take down” videos. But the brand was ahead of its time in plenty of ways, including the Glossier sweatshirt it first started selling in 2014.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/24/2f38ce34-8470-4792-bdbc-787775eb627f_095c17fb.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Curated beauty retailer Violet Grey also sells sweatshirts, while haircare brand Ouai has a range of branded sweatpants, combs, dog toys and more.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Anastasia Lloyd-Wallis, chief operating officer at Retail Doctor Group, a retail consultancy, says merchandise can be a good way for influencers and brands to foster community and connection. This is especially relevant in a world recovering from the global pandemic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Post-pandemic customers are more interested in building a connection and being part of a community. Whilst it was previously mainly retailers and FMCG [fast-moving consumer goods] brands that tried to build these communities as a way of building customer loyalty, this concept of a community is expanding,” she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/24/b8d3c6b8-f66b-4823-86d7-df408da2a551_402b1192.jpg>Lloyd-Wallis says a foray into merchandise, especially for a popular social media account or <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">influencer</span></a>, can provide ample opportunity for “emotional engagement” with a brand – so long as it’s done well.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When trying to establish your brand, it is important to understand who your customer is, as each customer has very different emotional needs … it may be the need for human interaction, trust, care. Or it may be more self-serving, for example to show they are ahead of the trend and stand out from their peers. So understanding what they expect to get out of the relationship is important,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Creating merchandise that felt authentic to both the brand and the community around it was important for Anna Mackenzie. Mackenzie, along with Caitlin Judd, hosts the popular Australia-based podcast Lady-Brains. The business- and ideas-focused podcast runs interviews with female business founders and the duo also offer a series of online programmes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/24/259081d4-a134-4596-88aa-90573fdcd404_c55f8cbf.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The pair, who have backgrounds in marketing, strategy and operations, launched the first drop of merchandise in August 2021. Mackenzie says it’s been a success well beyond the extra revenue stream.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We’re mostly an online business – on our podcast, we interview world-class founders about their business building journeys, and we teach aspiring founders to build their own brands through our online courses. Because of this, we wanted to find a way to bring our brand to life in a tangible, physical way. We wanted to give our listeners the chance to own a little bit of Lady-Brains,” says Mackenzie.</p>The pair already had connections with the apparel industry, partnering with <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Australian Fashion Week</span></a> to host live podcasts in 2021 and interviewing leaders in fashion. So the merchandise made sense that way, too.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/24/3d3a3965-606d-4b04-baa2-0632831fad3d_d3fadf65.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, more importantly, the merchandise aligns with the podcast’s values in other ways too: it’s made consciously, available on pre-order to avoid waste, and the podcast’s community was involved in voting in products and colourways. The merchandise, which drops two to three times per year, is always made with a female-founded local brand.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s also become an excellent advertisement for the podcast.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Apparel made sense, and it’s also what our consumer told us they wanted … not only has the merch been a great revenue generator for us, it has meant that the biggest champions in our community have become real-life billboards for our brand. We often receive DMs [direct messages] from people who have connected with others on the street because they’re both wearing Lady-Brains merch. We love to hear it!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/24/9847c5fa-8928-4c94-8566-bfc5d99ac700_82832968.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ultimately, Mackenzie says the merchandise works because it feels authentic and purpose-driven.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Any brand can create merchandise, but it’s hard to create merch that also has the intangible ‘cool’ factor,” she says. “There are a few factors that will help a brand get it right.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Firstly, the brand has to have a deep connection to their community … Secondly, it’s helpful to involve the community during the design development process to get their buy in … Thirdly, like any great marketing campaign, the range has to have some greater meaning or story behind it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our latest range of summer merch was built around the concept of ‘playtime’. We spoke about the fact that getting away from the desk and doing things just for the fun of it ultimately leads to a better life and a better business. This messaging landed with our community, and led to higher sales.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Actually, maybe someone ought to put that on a T-shirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlkpqutsDYaJirrJmYuaZ7kmptcWphbnypu9ZmpJ6qk516qrrSrZigqpGieqq6xaWsnqaTmr%2B0edOioq2nm2LAta3RrGSappRir6at1K2w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./honeymoon-ohio-newlywed-nate-kuhlman-freak-waterskiing-accident-html.html><span>←</span><span>Honeymoon horror as Ohio newlywed Nate Kuhlman dies in freak waterskiing accident in St Lucia just t</span></a>
