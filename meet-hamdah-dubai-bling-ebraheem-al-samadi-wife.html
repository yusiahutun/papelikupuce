Unlike Ebraheem, she wishes to keep herself away from the spotlight. So, although she has been mentioned several times in the show we can’t expect to see her on the show. They “met her [his wife] in Chicago,” according to a source who left a remark on Ebraheem’s Instagram, and “He wants to keep her out of his work. That’s what she told me.”</p><p>Early in 2023, they were <a href=#>married</a> on Saadiyat Island at the Rixos Premium Saadiyat Abu Dhabi. Attendees at the celebration, which was organized by White Seasons Events, included Dubai Bling celebrities Lojain Omran and Farhana Bodi. The exquisite details, immaculate décor, and an abundance of roses, of course, made Ebraheem Al Samadi’s wedding one to remember.</p><p>Even though Hamdah’s face isn’t featured on Dubai Bling, episode three depicts their heartfelt ceremony with his then-fiance, and episode five shows them spending private time together before the big day. The idea of hiding Hamdah’s face from Netflix users has left them completely perplexed, and many have resorted to social media to debate it.</p><p>When Ebraheem went to a fragrance event two years ago, he found out from one of the attendees that their relative was a lover of his Forever Rose brand. After speaking over the phone, they agreed to meet her cousin and her family in Global Village.</p><p>“When we finally met, I noticed her holding an infant, who I thought was her baby. I later found out that she was the baby’s aunt. Despite the mix-up, we hit it off and became friends from that point forward,” Ebraheem recalled.</p><p>Ebraheem gave his millions of Instagram followers a brief update when the Islamic contracts were signed to perform the marriage. He shared a stunning photo of himself online, posing in his Bisht, along with his compliments and the thrilling formal announcement. He also mentioned the Samadi and Al Hamly families’ official union, even if he didn’t provide anything further.</p><p>“I am a celebrity while she is not, which means that privacy is a challenge for us,” Ebraheem said. “People constantly pull out their phones and try to take pictures, which can be quite annoying. She often shares with me what people say about us, especially when it’s positive. On the other hand, it upsets her when people say negative things about me, especially when they are unaware that she is my wife. As she is not in the public eye, people do not recognize our relationship, which can lead to uncomfortable situations when she overhears remarks about us in public places.”</p><p>Ebraheem asserts that every one of them has a distinct romantic gesture of their own. He enjoys giving her small surprises, such as sending her romantic messages or surprising her with a trip to her favorite concert. Ebraheem is in Dubai and she resides in Abu Dhabi, so on weekends, they alternate visits.</p><p>Speaking more about his wife. Hamdah shared, “My wife is my perfect match, and together we create a beautiful partnership that brings me immense joy.” He added they are opposite. Despite many differences, they have many similarities as well including a “sense of humor.”</p><h3><strong>Is Hamadh Ebraheem Al Samadi’s First Wife?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Hamadh is the first wife of Ebraheem Al Samadi. Although he had reservations about his marriage because of his brother’s perspective, Ebraheem ended up settling with Hamadh as he believed people could have individual experiences.</p><h3><strong>Ebraheem Al Samadi Wife Hamadh Age</strong></h3><p>Reportedly born around 1990, Hamadh the wife of Ebraheem Al Samadi is at least 33 years old as of 2023.</p><h3><strong>Ebraheem Al Samadi Wife Hamadh Last Name</strong></h3><p>Ebraheem Al Samadi’s wife Hamadh’s last name is likely Al Hamly.</p><h3><strong>Is Ebraheem Al Samadi Wife On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>No, Ebraheem Al Samadi’s wife is not on social media.
