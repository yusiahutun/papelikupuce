Located at the head of Port Philip Bay, Melbourne is the capital city of Victoria, Australia. It is known to be the sporting capital as well, because of its craze for sports and hosting renowned sports events.&nbsp;</p><p>The city has a population of over 5 million and has been home to Aboriginal Victorians for over 40 thousand years. It is also an important meeting place for local Kulin nation clans, Wurundjeri, Boonerwrung, Taungurong, Djajawurrung, and the Wathaurung, and is the second most populous city in Australia.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Four Seasons In a Day – Get to Know The Climate of Melbourne</h2><p>The people of Melbourne refer to the city’s climate as ‘four seasons in a day’. Though it might be an exaggeration but the city does experience unpredictable weather because of its geography. It is wedged between southern arctic influences and northern desert winds. Hence, it can go from cloudy to rainy to chilly in a single day.</p><p>Tough, it might not be on an everyday basis. The city does experience stable, typical weather for the time of the year, with the occasional sudden shift. If you want to experience the city in any month, make sure to carry layers of clothes with you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Summertime</strong> is between <strong>December to February</strong> and can get extremely hot. <strong>March to May</strong> months witness the <strong>Fall season</strong> that illuminates the city and trees get adorned in golden foliage. The months of <strong>June to August</strong> are dreary and cold <strong>winter season</strong> but it rarely snows there. <strong>September to November</strong> is the <strong>spring season</strong> when the flower starts to bloom in the city.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Best Time to Travel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1.1-The-best-time-travel-Source-HuffPost.jpg><p>The best time to see the metropolitan city of Melbourne is between <strong>March to May</strong> and <strong>September to November</strong> when the city is covered with vibrant hues of color and decent temperature.</p><p>If you want to enjoy the beaches that are close to the city, December to February can be the ideal months.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How Melbourne came to be – Know It’s History</h3><p>Melbourne was founded in <strong>1835</strong>, on the <strong>Yarra River</strong> after an abortive bid in 1803 to establish a settlement inside the Port Phillip Bay heads near Sorrento. It respectfully acknowledges that it is located in the traditional land of the Kulin Nation and has been an important place and location for meetings and events.</p><p>The city grew and became a bustling hub of trade and commerce fueled by the gold rush of the 1850s, which contributed to its growth in population. People from all corners of the globe came to Melbourne in search of fortune, and with this wealth came culture too. The streets filled with buildings, theaters, and galleries.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 1890s, it saw economic downturns and labor strikes, as the workers fought for fair wages and better conditions. World War I and the Great Depression brought hardship and sacrifice over the city. Yet, it endured and reinvented itself. After the war, the coming years saw a wave of immigration and made the city the diverse and multicultural metropolis it is known as today.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Exploring Melbourne Culture</h2><p>Melbourne is a multicultural city that is named as the <strong>Cultural Capital of Australia</strong> by its inhabitants.
