She became the runner-up for Miss USA in 1986 and moved to New York City to pursue acting in modeling. According to Us Weekly, she was homeless briefly but started her first stint in acting in the ABC television series&nbsp;Living Dolls. She made her film debut in Spike Lee’s Jungle Fever where she played a drug addict. She earned her first big paycheck for $1 million to star in&nbsp;Executive Decision.</p><p>Berry starred in Swordfish where she was paid <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/music/14267/britney-spears-net-worth/ rel="noreferrer noopener">$2 million initially.</a> Around this time, the media reported that her salary was upped by $500,000 so she could do a topless scene. Berry denied this to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.cinema.com/articles/471/swordfish-interview-with-halle-berry.phtml>Cinema.com </a>“Totally not true. I would sell these babies for way more money.”</p><p>She won her first Oscar for the movie Monster’s Ball where she was the first African-American woman to win Best Actress. “When [Monster’s Ball] came to me, I thought, okay, I’m getting no money to do this movie and it could either catapult my career or it could end it instantly,” she told <a href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelleyzalis/2017/07/03/advice-from-halle-berry-on-getting-paid-what-youre-worth/?sh=50f998bef5d2" rel=nofollow>Forbes.</a> The sexual component to that movie was so risky and…I was so worried about being exploited and having people feel like I was being exploited, but at the end of the day, at my soul, I’m an artist.”</p><p>What may be Berry’s most top earning paycheck would be her starring role in Catwoman. She reportedly earned $14 million. Though a box office bomb, she explained how it affected her life when she won the Matrix Award from New York Women in Communication. “Everybody around me said, ‘Girl, don’t do it. It’s going to be the death of you. It’s going to end your career.’ But guess what I did? I followed my intuition and I did a movie called&nbsp;Catwoman&nbsp;and it bombed miserably,” Berry said. “While it failed to most people, it wasn’t a failure for me because I met so many interesting people that I wouldn’t have met otherwise, I learned two forms of martial arts and I learned not what to do.” She also added that she made “a shit-load of money that changed my life.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.9797687861272><h2>Halle Berry Divorce Settlement & Child Support</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/halle-berry-olivier-martinez.jpg><p>According to <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.tmz.com/2023/08/23/halle-berry-olivier-martinez-settle-finalize-divorce-child-support-son-maceo/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TMZ</a>, Berry has to give $8,000 a month to Olivier Martinez for child support for their son Maceo. She will also pay an additional 4.3 percent of all income she receives above $2 million. The divorce took over 7 years to finalize from when they first announced their separation in 2016.</p><p>The outlet also reported that Berry must cover Maceo’s private school tuition and 100 percent of his extracurricular activities, including soccer. She also must pay for Maceo’s health insurance — both medical and dental — as well as any uninsured expenses.</p><p>The outcome is similar to her divorce and custody settlement with ex-husband Gabriel Aubry. In 2014, a judge ruled that Berry had to pay over $16,000 a month in child support to provide for their daughter Nahla until she turns 19. She also had to cover their private school tuition. In 2012, Aubry and Martinez were in a physical fight over Nahla’s custody, leading to Aubry’s arrest.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfna6tuMRmmZ6qoq56pbXVqKmcnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./royal-ascot-2019-hats.html><span>←</span><span>The Best Hats from Royal Ascot 2019</span></a>
