As shoppers flee, a journalist tackles the shooter, bringing him down. The aftermath of the incident, played out from various viewpoints, exposes deep fault lines in Taiwanese society.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I decided to depict a random killing after reading news articles about a similar occurrence in 2014,” says Lou Yi-an, director and co-writer of Goddamned Asura, which has been selected as Taiwan’s submission for the best international feature category at the 2023 Academy Awards.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People debating the death penalty called the perpetrator a demon, which made me uncomfortable. What kind of person deserves to die because of a crime he committed? I wanted to explore the real person behind that debate.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Goddamned Asura is Lou’s third feature, after A Place of One’s Own (2009) and White Lies, Black Lies (2016).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lou tells the story from several viewpoints: a workaholic media manager, a manga artist, a gaming-obsessed clerk, a struggling student living in subsidised housing. Each one is depicted with unusual insight and sympathy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s funny you bring that up,” Lou laughs in response to my description, “because some people say I am not very good to my characters, I don’t really like them, I hate them – things like that. So let me say that I used my own background and personality to build them. I want to show that everyone has a dark side, including me.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Park Chan-wook, Cannes best director winner, on his film Decision to Leave</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I realise that I make excuses for myself, for my behaviour, and that’s what I do with my characters as well. They come from different classes, and they all have their own flaws and deficiencies. I try to find the reasons for their actions. I’m asking if their sins are too big to be forgiven.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lou splits the film into chapters that replay the shooting from different angles – and with different outcomes. That idea of incorporating “what if?” scenarios came to him late in the writing process.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I was trying to show how Jan-wen, the shooter, could be innocent,” he says of the character played by Joseph Huang Sheng-qiu, “but I couldn’t make it work without changing what he did. So I let the six main characters redo their stories in different ways.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/11/5739136c-9554-4598-bc83-e290223f7e92_aba5d380.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">No matter what the scenario, life is still cruel in Goddamned Asura. Linlin (Wang Yu-xuan, who won best supporting actress at the 2021 Golden Horse Awards for this role) could be a brilliant mathematician, but she is held back by her poverty.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I wanted to tell the audience that it’s just not that easy for a girl from the bottom of society,” Lou says. “It’s hard for her to make changes, to have a different life.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lou admits that his past films were dark, and that he tried to give his characters here more possibilities. But at the same time, he makes their situation like that of Sisyphus from the Greek myth, who in the underworld is forced to push a boulder up a hill for all eternity, only to have it roll back down as he nears the top.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The harder my characters want to climb uphill, the harder I want to pull them down. We all do things in life over and over again, even though they never work.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/11/6cf0f04a-ebf8-41a2-a786-17ffa856a12b_91abe109.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lou says the night market was the hardest location to film. Only for an hour before midnight, when the market shut, were there few enough people to control the scene. After midnight, with the stalls closed, the market looked too empty.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To make matters even more complicated, Lou had to film several versions of the shooting, working in bits and pieces, choreographing actors and extras for each separate take.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The rest of the scenes were much simpler,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/11/efe97c5f-2154-4f78-a59f-b8a1f5f214d0_6d25243c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lou doesn’t like doing rehearsals because he doesn’t want his performers following the script too closely. Occasionally he adjusts scenes by adding lines of dialogue, depending on how actors react to each other.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The way I work with actors is pretty relaxed,” he says. “There’s no set way of doing things. We will talk about what they feel on set, and they perform in the way so that they’re comfortable.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An especially powerful scene takes place in prison between Jan-wen and his mother, played by actress Ding Ning. As she begs her son to accept a plea bargain, Lou has the camera push in slowly on the performers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In that scene, they were reacting to each other in ways that weren’t in the script,” Lou says. “They would suddenly be silent and look down. Those silences disrupted the tempo I wanted to use to establish their emotions, but what they did was actually more interesting.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That’s not something you can just rehearse and get. I think it’s important for actors to really live in the moment. [Ding’s] reactions were very organic. She gave a perfect performance every time I said ‘action’. Ding is a mother herself, so I didn’t need to do anything to shape her emotions on set.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/11/efbbdcd6-0e2a-4ec3-9516-086bdaeab74f_22476754.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In another scene, Linlin’s mother throws a bottle at her during a fight. At first, Lou wanted Wang’s reaction to be an angry one.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But she had a different interpretation. She responded coolly, she just stopped and stared at her mother, tears in her eyes. I thought she was amazing. Her take was actually richer than what’s in the script. I really love it when actors give me things like that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/11/a62674f1-93f1-4577-a17b-c62b0858ddf8_63ed4884.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The “Asura” in the title of the film comes from a character in an online game that the characters play.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Asura is a Hindu god who represents anger and violence,” Lou says. “You know, my original title was ‘Starting Over’, which my producer and I both agreed was missing something.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Lou’s eyes, the six main characters in Goddamned Asura make up a cross-section of Taiwanese society. “They represent different colours, and they all come together to form a kind of kaleidoscopic image.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/11/24d2bd39-37f5-4aa8-82ba-44a6b4ad67ef_914d7424.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As for Jan-Wen, the shooter? What does he represent?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I wanted to show the audience that he’s just a kid,” Lou says. “He happened to take a divergent path. I sometimes think if I made other choices when I was 18, I would be a totally different person now. Then I wonder which one is the real me.”</p>Want more articles like this?
