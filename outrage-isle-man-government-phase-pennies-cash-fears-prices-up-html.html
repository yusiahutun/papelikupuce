I say: "No, I am staying in my world, you come into my world".'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Spencer Benham, who runs The Book Company in Douglas, said young people don't recognise pennies as money as more.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said: 'We're finding, again with inflation, that the one or two pence pieces are so small that it doesn't really mean anything. Sometimes the younger generation don't carry cash on them whatsoever.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I've even seen some kids, if they get pennies in their change, they just walk down the street and throw them on the floor. They don't even see it as money, just a burden in their pocket.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr Benham argued that the cash rounding would not lead to increased prices because most businesses would prefer to lower prices so they are more competitive.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said: 'If anything, they are not going to round up, they are going to round down to 95p. I think the five pence piece will become the new penny, eventually, if they get rid of the pennies and twos'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And Mark Kneen, of the Hydro Hotel, agreed that the copper coins were 'pointless' as most businesses have already rounded their prices - just like the Mexican restaurant in his hotel.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Andy Gibbs, owner of pub Jaks, said businesses on the Island have already adapted to card payments due to the pandemic.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said: 'It really is everyone, even the oldest. It's just easy, especially with Apple Pay and things like that coming along.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I've been here 33 years, and 33 years ago you went into a pub and you'd pay £1.01 a pint. But we didn't do that, we did £1, or £1.05, £1.10. We didn't use twos and ones,' he explained.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr Gibbs added: 'I think if they do get rid of them [low-value coins] all the banks on the Isle of Man will be inundated with everyone clearing their piggy bank out.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dr Alex Allinson MHK, the Isle of Man's treasury minister, said&nbsp;research from other countries suggested the inflation concerns were unfounded.</p><img id=i-318698557f6b8df1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/01/26/13/80500461-13009687-The_Manx_people_are_concerned_about_added_inflation_but_added_th-a-2_1706274880680.jpg height=426 width=634 alt="The Manx people are concerned about added inflation but added that the pennies are not really used anymore" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The Manx people are concerned about added inflation but added that the pennies are not really used anymore</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said: 'Most of the businesses here didn't think it would cause significant inflation.

Part of it is just the economics – that to make a 1p coin now costs more than a 1p coin is worth. We haven't minted them in a while.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Even the 5p pieces, we calculate now that each one is about 20p. It is getting more and more expensive to produce currency.
