As collaborator to Newt Knight and the Knight Company, Mississippi’s most notorious band of Civil War deserters, she may have played a pivotal role in the band’s ability to elude Confederate arrest. She is most famous, however, as the mother of several of Newt Knight’s many children. The children born to Rachel, but also to other mixed-race families such as the Smiths and the Ainsworths (with whom the Knights intermarried), comprised complex branches of multiracial descendants who today variously identify themselves as white, brown, black, Indian, or a mixture of all four. One of those descendants, Sondra Yvonne Bivins, has researched and written extensively on the communities they built. In the following series of posts, Yvonne shares much of her research with Renegade South. This is the third and final installment of the three-part series.</p><p><strong>By Sondra Yvonne Bivins</strong></p><p>Special to the Leader-Call</p><p>Slaves had few legal rights, least of all to marry and have children. Just two years after arriving on Jackie Knight’s place, Rachel became the slave mistress of his son Jesse Davis Knight. Illicit interracial sexual relationships were not unusual in the antebellum South in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Jesse Davis Knight’s liaison with Rachel resulted in the birth of three known children: Jeffery Earley, Edmund and Frances.</p><p>Early in 1858, Rachel gave birth to a son, her third child. Jeffery Earley was born a slave, owned by his grandfather John “Jackie” Knight. By law, the status of the mother determined the status of the children, so Rachel and her children were his property. After slavery, while still a teenager, Jeffery married Martha Ann Eliza Jane, “Mollie,” the daughter of Serena and Newton Knight.</p><p>The rumor mill started immediately, with claims that Newt forced his daughter to marry the former slave boy who in physical appearance was nearly white and who after all shared the same grandfather.</p><p>To local whites, it was just impossible for a white girl to become attracted to and fall in love with a Negro. However,&nbsp;to the family, this was just the case. Jeffery and Mollie had grown up working and playing together on Newton’s farm. Newton was well aware of this, and so he determined to erase any vestige of Negro in both Rachel’s and George Ann’s children.</p><p>To the union of Jeffery and Mollie were born the following children: Ollie&nbsp;Jane (1883); Charles Madison (1886); Lawrence Larkin (1887); Altimara (1890); Leonard Ezra (1892); Chauncie Omar (1897); and Otho (1900). In 1890, Jeffery had an outside affair with Newton’s youngest daughter Cora Ann, and fathered a son named Billy (1891). In March 1817, two months after Mollie died from uterine cancer, he married Susan Ella Smith. J. E. lived and died in the Six Town Community and did not associate socially with Blacks.</p><p>Edmond was born on Feb. 8, 1861, two months prior to the first shots fired at Fort Sumter, S.C. He died when he was about 16 or 17 years old. Frances, who was called Fan, was born March 18, 1863 and married Newt’s white son George Madison (“Matt”) in December 1878. She had nine children before he deserted&nbsp;her for a white cousin named Francis Smith. Fan later married an itinerate&nbsp;preacher named Dock Howze from Clarke County. In 1914, she denied under&nbsp;<span style=line-height:1.5>oath that she was black. It is possible,&nbsp;</span><span style=line-height:1.5>but not proven, that Dock Howze was a part-Choctaw whose given name was Benson Howze.</span></p><p>According to family stories, Jeffrey Early and Fan both had deep-seeded issues with being defined as “Negroes.” Although Fan had delicate features, she could not pass for a white person, so she claimed to be mixed with French and Native American. All of Jeffrey Early’s children by Newton’s daughter Mollie married white, almost white or to relatives to avoid being classified as Negroes. They were raised as white in an isolated environment and had difficulty being accepted by either whites or blacks. Their situation reminds me of the song that Kermit the Frog sang about “It’s Not Easy Being Green.”</p><p><strong>Rachel’s children by Newton Knight</strong></p><p>The ex-slave Martha Wheeler said&nbsp;it best. Children of white fathers were given privileges that other former slaves did not have. As soon as Newton’s children were old enough, the indoctrination began. Newt indoctrinated them with an elitist attitude that made them believe they were somehow better than&nbsp;the average black because of their white blood. He helped build a school in the community and attempted to send his children by Rachel to that school. When the local whites rejected them, it is said that he burned it down.</p><p>Martha Ann Knight was born Aug. 15, 1866. She had long, bushy hair and light complexion, café au lait, or coffee with cream color. She married Samuel Knight, whose parents were Daniel Thomas Knight, Newt’s cousin, and Harriet Carter, another of John Knight’s slaves. Martha and Samuel had four children: Sidney, Amos, Viola Ode and Senia. Martha and Samuel encouraged their children to marry someone of their own kind. All except Senia married a cousin. Senia fell in love with and married a black man named Robert Johnson. The couple eventually had to move away to avoid harassment.</p><p>John Stewart, born&nbsp;in May 1868, was believed by family members to be homosexual and never married. Anyone breaking the peace in&nbsp;the family was accused&nbsp;of acting like Stewart. Living alone, he was brutally hacked to death in 1920 by locals looking for money.</p><p>John Floyd was born&nbsp;in 1871. His first wife was a white girl named Sophronia Cox. He married her in 1890. The marriage was witnessed by her brother Richard C. Cox. There is no record of Floyd’s marriage to Lucy Ainsworth Smith. Quill Anderson stated that his family moved to the Soso area around 1895. Floyd and Lucy had three children: William Wilder (1895), Ivy Jane (1898) and Octavia “Tavy” (1900). Floyd died in 1942 after suffering&nbsp;a stroke. He is buried in the cemetery of Shady Grove Church in the Kelly Settlement Community.</p><p>Augusta Ann “Gustan” was born April 22, 1873. After the death&nbsp;of her mother, she lived with several of her siblings, the last of whom was Martha Ann. Gustan married William Watts&nbsp;of Lamar County in 1906. Her children attended Oakwood College in Huntsville, Ala.</p><p>John “Hinchie” Madison was born in 1875. Hinchie married Lucy Ainsworth’s daughter Mary Florence Magdalene “Maggie” Smith in 1893. Their marriage is recorded in the white Marriage Record Book at the Ellisville courthouse. Hinchie was a prosperous farmer. His 15 children mostly remained in the Soso community or in Mississippi, with a few moving to California in the 1950s.</p><p>With the exception of John Floyd during his brief marriage to Sophronia Cox, none of Rachel’s children fathered by Newton passed for white.</p><p><strong>Open secrets</strong></p><p>In the antebellum South and after the War, white men believed and accepted that it was a natural rite of passage&nbsp;to manhood to sexually exploit black women, which resulted in families of mixed-race children like those of Rachel Knight. Everyone in the slave community knew who fathered Rachel’s children, but it was not openly discussed. Since she was raised from birth to be a slave, Rachel was aware that she did not own her own body; she was property and did not have the right to reject sexual advances.</p><p>The white woman, on the other hand, was expected to be a loving and dutiful wife, an affectionate mother and subservient to her husband. It was easy for her to blame the slave for her husband or son’s indiscretion. In the South, white women were powerless and little more than servants, too. Unlike today, divorcing a husband who had extramarital relationships was frowned upon and not easy to obtain. The white mistress often punished the slave woman for her husband’s wrong-doings, telling herself that the powerless slave seduced her husband or even demanding that the slave be sold to remove the temptation.</p><p>There remains to this day a hush-hush “open secret” and outright denial of past race-mixing in the South by slave masters. After emancipation, Newt, like many fathers of mixed-race families, provided land and financial assistance to his offspring, which resulted sometimes in the development of elitist attitudes among them and resentment by neighbors, both black and white. Often when a mixed-race person was successful&nbsp;in any endeavor, whites would exclaim that it was their “white blood.”</p><p>In general, after the Civil War, blacks were treated with callous contempt by whites. However, children fathered by their former masters were given a certain amount of protection from local harassment that lasted as long as the white father lived.</p><p>The descendants of Rachel Knight, who&nbsp;were neither accepted nor openly rejected by their white and black neighbors, came under attack after Newt Knight died in 1922. Two of Fan Knight’s grandchildren, Rachel Dorothy and Fred Nolan, were poisoned by local whites in the early ’20s, while Fan and Dock Howze both died under mysterious circumstances in 1916. It should be noted that Newton was not the only white man in Jones and neighboring counties committing miscegenation. The others simply did not openly flaunt their relationships.</p><p><strong>Narrative of Martha Wheeler, former slave of ‘Jackie’ Knight</strong></p><p>In the 1930s, as part of the Federal Writers’ Project of the Works Progress Administration, to interview former slaves to preserve a picture of the African-American experience with slavery. Martha Wheeler was interviewed in the Hebron neighborhood when she was 86 years old. She states in the interview that she was one of Jacky Knight’s slaves born on his place and, at the age of 8, was sold Elizabeth Coleman Knight after his death.</p><p>The following is what she had to say about Newt, Rachel and George Ann:</p><p>“For many years, the Knights seldom married outside of their family, but Newt and his family were the only ones&nbsp;to mix extensively with the Negroes. Rachel was considered his woman, then he moved her to his place and her daughter, Georgiann, took her place and separated him from his wife, who went out and lived, until her death a few years ago, among her children. He never married the Negro but brought up a family of seven with her at his old home place and died among them. He is buried in Jasper County half way between Stringer and Soso, one mile west of the road. His Negro children were&nbsp;given advantages and&nbsp;<span style=line-height:1.5>are said by many to be handsome. One girl lives in the old home. Another is high in school circles and served as a missionary to Japan and a third married a white man from other parts and has never been back home. His wife is buried at Palestine Church, three miles from Laurel on the Bay Springs road, now U. S. Highway 15. Newt’s parents, Mason and Albert, are buried at Hebron cemetery right&nbsp;</span><span style=line-height:1.5>at Solon Huff’s house. Their graves are probably at the beginning of the cemetery.”</span></p><p><strong>Embracing my one drop of African blood</strong></p><p>After being questioned by a friend, I had to take a bit of time to reflect on why I choose to embrace my “one drop” of African blood and must admit that it has been an emotional reflection. It would be very difficult to believe that I am African American if I did not tell you so.</p><p>When I began researching my family line, something or someone kept tugging at me to keep digging for the truth. I knew that once I published my ancestry, it would cause some anxiety and denial from some of my relatives. I felt a deep sense of needing to connect with my ancestor and became curious to know just who that woman was that survived the anguishing trip from the shores of Africa and endured the horrors of slavery, never-ending work and rape.</p><p>I envisioned that she was young, strong and slender with a coal black complexion and kinky hair – not like the character that Ethel Knight described in “Echo of the Black Horn,” which is the only description of Rachel that exists other than what I was told about her. It seems to me that she was calling me to set the record straight, because so many of her descendants had either denied her existence or claimed she was something other than a strong black woman.</p><p>If I could meet her mother, I would want&nbsp;to know where she was born, the places she lived, when she was abducted and when and by whom she was captured. Did she come directly to the New World or did she get broken&nbsp;in the Caribbean Islands? How many generations passed before Rachel was born?</p><p>These are questions that will forever remain unanswered because my family lineage stops with a bill of sale when she was purchased by John “Jackie” Knight.</p><p>As a child, I grew up in an environment where I was instilled with middle class values and taught to be proud of my racial heritage. I was taught to value honest work and an education and not&nbsp;the color of my skin or any other physical attributes. My mother made many sacrifices for us, never missing a day of work in 32 years in order that we might go to college. She was a great role model.</p><p>I remember that my grandmother was often asked by whites why she chose to be black. She would boldly say that she chose to be black because, if she were white, she’d be poor white and would rather be a dog. She didn’t think too highly of poor whites. According to her, they had been white and free all their lives and no reason to be poor. My grandfather just quietly accepted his lot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwuM6cmKVnm6O2qLTTrGSeqpFiu7DAjJqjpWWSoa6kt4yapZ1lp522tbGOmqmtoZOhsqCylWlqnW9oZ3p3spSbZG6cYpt6o7LBa2RvaZRthqSuw2manZxencGuuA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./362865-kcmc-online-application-entry-requirements-20202021-intake-html.html><span>←</span><span>KCMC online application and entry requirements for 2020/2021 intake</span></a>
