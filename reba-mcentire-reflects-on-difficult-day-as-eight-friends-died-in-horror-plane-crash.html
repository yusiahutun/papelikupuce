We, the thousands of fans in the audience cried right along with you as you fought through tears to finish the set. You did them proud.”</p><p>“For My Broken Heart is literally one of the saddest songs I’ve ever heard. I was a kid when it came out and didn’t know the true meaning behind it. RIP to all your bandmates. What a sad loss,” penned a second.</p><p>A third wrote: “I still wonder how you overcame such a tragedy. It was so very sad that you lost your backup band.
