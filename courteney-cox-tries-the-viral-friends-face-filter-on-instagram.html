Okay, I think my eyebrows are a little different...Rachel? I don't buy it."</h2><p><a href=#>Courteney Cox</a> is putting herself in the shoes of her fellow "Friends" castmates -- or rather their faces.</p><p>Over the weekend the 57-year-old actress discovered the viral "Friends" face filter which hilariously plasters the face of each cast member onto the face of the user. Cox had some fun of her own cycling through the faces of six of the sitcom's most iconic characters to test their accuracy.</p><p>"Apparently, there's a new 'Friends' face app," she stated in a short video to Instagram. "Let's check it out." The actress began by testing the authenticity of <a href=#>David Schwimmer</a>'s face as Ross Gellar.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"Hi…" Cox imitated his voice unimpressed. "Really? I don't look anything like Schwimmer."</p><p>The filter then turned her into <a href=#>Matt LeBlanc</a>'s beloved character Joey Tribbiani, which Cox deemed more accurate than the previous filter.</p><p>"Joey. Hi! How you doin'?" she said echoing the character's iconic catchphrase. "Oh, looks good with an earring. Or two."</p><p>Despite the "Scream" star's ability to discern the last two faces, the third character proved to be a challenge for Cox to recognize as she began to doubt the accuracy of the filters.</p><p>"Oh hello," she remarked. "Who is that? Is that Monica? Not sure. Rachel? I don't know. This is one of the worst apps I've ever seen, but okay."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f2fcdb5b-b2fb-4fc5-b5a5-996b1257a4a4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2db9a23b-1fb2-496c-894e-9675d18607e7 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/47/5by4/2022/03/01/47a0b51daf294a46b1d88b710da06b80_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>Courteney Cox Reveals The Terrifying Reason She Sold Her Laurel Canyon Home</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Courteney finished out the cast and found her own character Monica Gellar, while she was able to quickly identify her own face she joked that the filter had begun to make her doubt her self confidence.</p><p>"Is that me? Okay, I think my eyebrows are a little different...Rachel? I don't buy it," she said.</p><p>After making it to her co-stars <a href=#>Matthew Perry</a> and <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a>'s characters, she commented on the face color the app gave Chandler Bing and revisited her character's filter.</p><p>"I feel terrible about myself," Courteney laughed.</p><p>Cox, Aniston, LeBlanc, Perry and <a href=#>Lisa Kudrow</a> starred in the iconic "Friends" sitcom together from 1994 to 2004. The cast reunited for an HBO special titled "Friends: The Reunion" last May where the cast reminisced about their favorite memories on set.</p><a id=gallery-link-e032729d-5f7a-4501-8359-249cb5ef1da9 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:e032729d-5f7a-4501-8359-249cb5ef1da9 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:2db9a23b-1fb2-496c-894e-9675d18607e7 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5a/4by3/2022/04/04/5a26cc7147fc42958161adc7030d832c_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j21maWxfmLy2vtOepZ6xXZi8uXnTq6Ceq12ptaZ51aKpmqRdm7%2Bqsc2dqmaekZiybrLIpaueql2ku261zayrmp%2Bilrpw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrities-over-age-40-bikini-photos-sexy-swimsuit-pictures.html><span>←</span><span>Celebrities Over Age 40 Bikini Photos: Sexy Swimsuit Pictures</span></a>
