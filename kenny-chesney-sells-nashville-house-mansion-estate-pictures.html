He initially asked $13,999,999 for the property, which is situated on a hilltop on 56 lushly wooded acres of land in the affluent rural Nashville suburb of Franklin, Tenn., where many other country stars also reside.</p><p>According to online property records, Chesney sold the house on Dec. 22, 2021, receiving $11.5 million for the exceptional home and surrounding land. That's a steep discount for the buyer, but it's still considerably more than the $9.25 million Chesney paid when he bought the estate in 2009. The sale price breaks down to $913 per square foot and a monthly payment of $47,653.</p><p>Called Bella Luce (Beautiful Light), the incredible residence is a vast Mediterranean villa outfitted with top-of-the-line amenities, including floors made from 150-year-old reclaimed walnut, Venetian plaster walls, hand-carved beams of cedar and Douglas fir, limestone fireplaces, a home theater, a gym, an elevator and a separate generator. The property also includes a lookout tower that offers spectacular 360-degree views of the surrounding countryside.</p><p>The exterior of the mansion features a circular stone driveway and courtyards, extensive outdoor entertaining and dining areas, an infinity-edge swimming pool and spa and meticulous landscaping. An attached garage offers parking for 6 cars, while a separate detached garage holds 4 more vehicles.</p><p><a href=#>Laura Putty Stroud</a> with <a href=#>French King Fine Properties</a> held the listing on Chesney's home.</p><p>Scroll through the pictures below to see inside Kenny Chesney's staggering hilltop Tennessee estate, and keep scrolling to see inside the incredible homes of <a href=#>Tim McGraw</a> and <a href=#>Faith Hill</a>, as well as <a href=#>Alan Jackson</a>.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Kenny Chesney's Spectacular $14 Million Tennessee Estate</h2><p>Kenny Chesney has listed his 4-bedroom, 9-bathroom, 12,599-square-foot hilltop estate in Tennessee for just under $14 million, and pictures show an opulent Mediterranean villa that is lavish even by the standards of other celebrity mansions.</p><p><strong>See Inside Tim McGraw + Faith Hill's Stunning Nashville Estate:</strong></p><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Look Inside Alan Jackson's Spectacular Hilltop Mansion:</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJ2eo8Zur8eeqqedqWLAprjLrGSnmaOdw6q4y55koaelqLJuucCnqqKnnmKytMDArZxmqJmYwba%2BxKxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./661362b946163ff35a8b4585-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jorge lvarez Mynez se queja del reloj en el Primer Debate Presidencial 2024</span></a>
