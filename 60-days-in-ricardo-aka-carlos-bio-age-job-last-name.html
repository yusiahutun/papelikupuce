Learn more about his age, job, wife & kids, and his last name in this article below.</p><p>Tag along with this bio to learn more about him.</p><h3><strong>Meet A&E’s 60 Days In Star Ricardo aka Carlos</strong></h3><p>What the casting directors were seeking in volunteers for the “social experiment series” is revealed through an old casting call.</p><p>“You’ll spend approximately 60 days trying to simultaneously outwit and gain the trust of those around you,” the listing read. “If you think you’re up for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, send a brief email explaining why you could survive in just about any setting, a little background on you, your career, adventures, and quick wits.” If chosen, potential convicts get a questionnaire and conduct an online interview.</p><p>One such cast of the show is Ricardo. Former gang member turned long-distance truck driver, Ricardo AKA Carlos. Ricardo joined a neighborhood gang despite coming from a strict home because he was lured by the group’s family atmosphere and felt it offered him meaning in life.</p><p>Ricardo still went back to living the gangster lifestyle after a brief stay in the county jail. He ultimately received a three-year prison term for illegally possessing a firearm. Young Ricardo was made to mature swiftly and learn how to defend himself at all costs when he initially entered the penitentiary.</p><p>The elder “lifers,” whose influence made Ricardo realize he never wanted to return to prison, were instrumental in helping him turn his life around. Ten years ago, Ricardo was freed and disconnected.</p><p>In the trailer of the show, he speaks with sheriff <a href=#>Reginald B Scandrett</a>. He shares that he believes that he has something to offer as an ex-con and can help change the lives of these kids. Reginald who is cautious welcomes him saying that he hopes that Carlos doesn’t become the problem instead for him to handle.</p><p>On the day of the premiere of the show, Ricardo announced, “Today is the day where the new season comes out everyone strap on and hold onto your seats it’s gonna be a bumpy ride to Tap in with me today when I go live￼ watch the show with me <a class="qi72231t nu7423ey n3hqoq4p r86q59rh b3qcqh3k fq87ekyn bdao358l fsf7x5fv rse6dlih s5oniofx m8h3af8h l7ghb35v kjdc1dyq kmwttqpk srn514ro oxkhqvkx rl78xhln nch0832m cr00lzj9 rn8ck1ys s3jn8y49 icdlwmnq cxfqmxzd d1w2l3lo tes86rjd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#60daysin</a> <a class="qi72231t nu7423ey n3hqoq4p r86q59rh b3qcqh3k fq87ekyn bdao358l fsf7x5fv rse6dlih s5oniofx m8h3af8h l7ghb35v kjdc1dyq kmwttqpk srn514ro oxkhqvkx rl78xhln nch0832m cr00lzj9 rn8ck1ys s3jn8y49 icdlwmnq cxfqmxzd d1w2l3lo tes86rjd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#jail</a>“.</p><h3><strong>60 Days In Ricardo Age</strong></h3><p>In 2022, Ricardo aka Carlos from 60 Days In should be above 38 years old.</p><h3><strong>60 Days In Ricardo Wife</strong></h3><p>Yes, 60 Days In star Ricardo aka Carlos has a wife Melissa Jiminez. According to his Facebook, he has been married since 13 March 2006. They are high school sweethearts. Not much is known about their relationship except that they completed their 16 years of marriage in March 2022. By profession, Melissa is a nurse.</p><p>Moreover, Ricardo and his wife, Melissa share two sons and a daughter. Their oldest son graduated from Corinth Holders High School in June 2022.</p><h3><strong>What Is 60 Days In Ricardo aka Carlos’s Last Name?</strong></h3><p><span class=rse6dlih>The last name of 60 Days In Ricardo is Jimenez. The fullname of Ricardo is Carlos Kirmc Prez Jimenez.</span></p><h3><strong>60 Days In Ricardo Job</strong></h3><p>The profession that 60 Days In star Ricardo is indulged in is driving. He is a truck driver. Indeed.com reports that an average truck driver in New York makes $108082 per year.</p><p>Besides that, Ricardo hasn’t opened up about his job on his socials. There is virtually nothing regarding his career of Ricardo on the web. However, his gig with A&E TV has made him a reality TV personality.</p><p>Apparently, A&E budgets for one-hour shows are estimated at $375,000 per episode, which means that “the maximum they are getting paid is roughly $3,000 per episode,” according to a former reality TV producer who posted some behind-the-scenes information on <a href=#>Reddit</a>.</p><p>The actual location where filming takes place is the show’s biggest revenue generator. The $60,000 that the Clark County jail earned from A&E, or about $500 each day over the period of 120 days, would be used for training and equipment upgrades, according to Clark County Sheriff Jamey Noel in an interview.</p><p>Sheriff Noel said, “[The money] will actually go to training and equipment for the jail, so everything that we do can better the jail operations. In addition, the show agreed to pay the representative’s base pay, and overtime expenses linked to the show’s filming.</p><p>According to Soap Dirt, participants who leave the show early receive a tiny payment for their time on camera. But not as much as someone who stays for the duration. After the contestants tap for early release, it seems that close friends and family members of the contestants may also get a little payment.</p><h3><strong>Is 60 Days In Ricardo On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>No, 60 Days In contestant Ricardo is not on Instagram.
