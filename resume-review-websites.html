Having a professional look at your resume before sending your job application can prevent you from making a detrimental mistake. The last thing you want is a typo-filled resume that costs you an interview.</p><p>If you don't trust your friends' or family members' proofreading ability, you can always turn to the online community of professional resume reviewers. Send your resume to one of these resume review sites and land your dream job.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=zipjob-resume-review>1. <a href=#>ZipJob Resume Review</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/resume-review-sites-1.jpg><p>ZipJob provides you with an in-depth resume-checking tool that can benefit your job search. Start by uploading your resume to the site. Enter your email address and submit your resume.</p><p>In the next 48 hours, you'll get a reply from a resume expert who has fully reviewed your resume. All of ZipJob's experts are certified through the Professional Association of Resume Writers & Career Coaches, so you can expect a trustworthy review.</p><p>The reviewer will provide feedback on your resume's design, formatting, as well as presentation. ZipJob will also run your resume through the ATS (Applicant Tracking System) that most employers use to filter out job candidates. To make this tool even better, it's completely free!</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=jobscan>2. <a href=#>Jobscan</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/resume-review-sites-2.jpg><p>In case you don't have the time to wait for a real-life reviewer to look at your resume, you can always use Jobscan's AI-powered tool. Jobscan analyzes your resume and shows you how you can improve it.</p><p>When you access Jobscan's tool, you'll notice two boxes: one for your resume, and one for a job description. After you paste (or upload) your resume, you'll have to paste the description of the job you're applying for. Hit&nbsp;<strong>Scan</strong>&nbsp;and Jobscan will present you with a detailed report in a matter of seconds.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Here, you'll see if your resume matches up to the job description you entered and whether it can make it past the ATS. Unfortunately, the free version of Jobscan limits the number of times you can use certain features (like the job match rate and keyword comparison tool), but it's still worth trying.</p><h2 id=topresume-resume-review>3. <a href=#>TopResume Resume Review</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/resume-review-sites-3.jpg><p>Not only does TopResume offer paid resume writing services, but it also features a free resume review tool. After uploading your resume to the site, you can expect a reply within 48 hours.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>TopResume's experts will then read through your resume, and highlight the portions that you need to improve on. In addition to getting constructive criticism on your resume's design, organization, mechanics, and writing, you'll also see how well your resume did in the ATS.</p><p>That said, it doesn't hurt to submit your resume to TopResume. If you're feeling frustrated with the number of errors that your resume wracks up, you might want to consider starting over and rebuilding your resume on a <a href=#>free resume maker</a>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=resume-worded>4. <a href=#>Resume Worded</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/resume-review-sites-4.jpg><p>ResumeWorded is one of the best resume review sites on the web. Once you get past the hassle of signing up for the website, you can finally upload your resume. As soon as you upload your file, you'll see a page of changes that you should make to your resume.</p><p>ResumeWorded scores your resume from zero to 100, with 100 being the perfect resume. At the top of the page, you'll see how your resume ranks in four different categories: impact, brevity, style, and skills. Mousing over any of these areas displays helpful hints on how to improve your score in each category.</p><p>When you scroll down the page, you'll see the top three changes that you need to make to your resume. If you want to see even more specific advice, ResumeWorded provides you with a line-by-line analysis. Several helpful features are available with ResumeWorded's free plan, but you'll have to upgrade to the Pro version to get full access to the site's tools.</p><h2 id=rezscore>5. <a href=#>RezScore</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/resume-review-sites-5.jpg><p>For a quick reality check on your resume, upload it to RezScore's review service. This site will flat out tell you if your resume desperately needs help. It's not the most thorough of the tools listed here, but it definitely can give you an idea of where you've gone wrong.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Upon uploading your resume, RezScore will provide you with a very honest score of A through F. Click the <strong>Resume</strong> tab at the top of the screen to see how your resume ranks in brevity, depth, and impact. RezScore will also give you some pointers on what exactly needs fixing.</p><p>In case the site-generated review isn't specific enough for you, you can hit the <strong>Get a Human Review</strong> button. With this tool, you can submit your resume to the RezScore community and get some feedback from real people.</p><h2 id=ladders-resume-reviewer>6. <a href=#>Ladders Resume Reviewer</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/resume-review-sites-6.jpg><p>Unlike the <a href=#>most popular job search engines</a>, Ladders focuses solely on high-paying jobs---however, it does much more than track down six-figure opportunities.</p><p>Head to Ladders' free resume review tool, and you can upload your resume for an instant review. While you have to sign up for an account to get access to the review, the insight you receive is worth it.</p><p>On the resume review page, Ladders will let you know what you did well, and what you could make better. Any red block in the lefthand column signals something that you need to add or improve on. Click on these boxes to expand them, and you'll see a detailed explanation of how exactly you should fix your resume.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Ladders will provide you with a list of recommended jobs based on the contents of your resume, but you'll have to pay for a Premium account to get the most out of the site's job search tool.</p><h2 id=improving-your-resume-with-a-resume-review-site>Improving Your Resume With a Resume Review Site</h2><p>Using one of these resume review sites will only improve your chances of landing a job.
