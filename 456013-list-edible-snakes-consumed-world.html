However, some</strong> <strong>see snakes as a delicious and nutritious meal. Edible snakes offer a myriad of health benefits. So, how much do you know about these snakes?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e35a5aa46c8c4a4a.jpg><p class=align-left>You may have probably heard stories about the Chinese eating snakes. If yes, have you stopped to ask whether it is true or false, or which type of snakes they eat? It is true that some Chinese and people from other races worldwide consume some snakes. Here's everything you should know about edible snakes.</p><h2>List of edible snakes</h2><p class=align-left>Can you eat any kind of snake? Not all snakes are edible. Therefore, when it comes to choosing an edible snake, it really depends on credible information lest you cause harm to yourself. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Afro Gist media</a>, these are the edible snakes.</p><h3>1. Copperhead</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c221c53d0cb65af3.jpg><p class=align-left>Copperhead snakes are some of the more commonly seen snakes. They have an elegant copper and black colour. They are the most likely to bite, although their venom is relatively mild, and their bites are rarely fatal for humans.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8fd7b0a4e228c912.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 cutest square acrylic nail designs to try out in 2022</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Copperhead snakes <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">have a yellow-tipped tail</a> when young. They use it to lure prey and can live for up to 18 years. Being a part of the pit viper group, they also have a blocky head and a hefty body. They are social and active during summer but only during day time.</p><h3>2. Cottonmouth</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8fd7b0a4e228c912.png><p class=align-left>Cottonmouths, also called water moccasins, are venomous snakes found in the southeastern United States. They are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">called cottonmouths because</a> of the white colouration on the inside of their mouths. They display this white colouration when threatened.</p><p class=align-left>The snakes have a black-brown shade and possess black bands which are dense on the top part of the snake’s body, narrowing down its body sides. They are semiaquatic, so they are comfortable both swimming in water and basking on land. They are pit vipers as are copperheads and rattlesnakes.</p><h3>3. Coral snakes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/adcd8c781d72ffc3.jpg><p class=align-left>Coral snakes are a large group of elapid snakes. They are subdivided into two distinct groups; Old <a href=#>World</a> coral snakes and New World coral snakes. The snake’s colourings are usually red on yellow on black.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f1e24c98099a64fb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of all black crystals and their meanings spiritually</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, the red and yellow colours must touch each other to enhance the snake's venom. These snakes are popularly in Asia and North America. Unlike other snake species, coral snakes do not grow big and may range from 3 to 5 feet long.</p><p class=align-left>Coral snakes mostly feed on frogs and blind snakes. Even though they are claimed to be venomous, their bite has a lesser likelihood of causing death, but it is painful.</p><h3>4. Rattlesnakes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2d5df94c8cfece4f.jpg><p class=align-left>Rattlesnakes are predators that live in an array of habitats. They hunt small animals such as birds and rodents for food. Their most recognisable feature is the rattle toward their tail end. It has an unmistakable sound and will rattle if bothered.</p><p class=align-left>There are sixteen different rattlesnakes species , and they grow between 0.9 cm to 1.2 cm long. They are active during the day and night in spring and hibernate during winter. They are found in the southern part of the United States.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6ae6aefc19bc97c4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Karen haircut: What is it and why should you avoid it?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Most people who have eaten rattlesnakes claim that they are the best due to their size.
