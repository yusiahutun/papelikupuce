While the ladies of Sex and the City didn’t invent a love of luxury shoes, they certainly helped bring the obsession with designer shoes into the mainstream. Our collective passion for futurewear has been going steady ever since, and designers have been upping their ante when it comes to the art of shoemaking. These days, there’s a luxury shoe for every style, whether you’re a sneakerhead, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>ballet flats</a> devotee, or a lover of sky-high strappy sandals.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From the red-soled stilettos of Christian Louboutin to the comfortable luxury of Gucci loafers and more, these are 15 of our favorite luxury shoe designers of all time.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-christian-louboutin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Christian Louboutin</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2023, Christian Louboutin celebrated the 30th anniversary of the brand’s famous signature: bright red soles, which started when Louboutin himself was unhappy with the black sole of a prototype shoe inspired by Andy Warhol’s ‘Flowers.” He borrowed a bottle of red nail polish from an assistant who had been painting her fingernails, and the rest is shoe history. While you can find anything from sneakers to loafers to pumps from the designer brand, the Louboutin name is synonymous with stiletto pumps. Celebs love them for a red carpet moment, from Cardi B (who referenced the famed red bottoms in her breakout hit “Bodak Yellow”) to Jennifer Lopez to Kerry Washington. Louboutins are sold at Net-a-Porter, Nordstrom, Sakes, and more.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-manolo-blahnik></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Manolo Blahnik</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So many of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Carrie Bradshaw</a>’s most memorable shoe moments were Manolo Blahnik, from the time she was robbed of her favorite sample sale strappy sandals at gunpoint to her unforgettable blue wedding shoes. And with the resurging popularity of kitten heels, celebs like Meghan Markle, Hailey Bieber, and Jennifer Lawrence have worn Manolos. The lower end of prices is $700 and boots can be up around $2000. Manolo Blahniks can be purchased at Saks, Neiman Marcus, Net-a-Porter, Bergdorf Goodman, and more.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-chanel></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Chanel</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Are you wearing the…?” Yep, the Chanel boots—and ballet flats, dad sandals, slingback heels, and more—need no further introduction. The house of Chanel was founded in 1910, but in 1957 they introduced the two-tone pumps that would become a signature style. The brand is also known for details like quilting that instantly recognizable interlocking Cs logo. The price of iconic footwear will cost you: flats typically start near $1,000 and boots could run upwards of $3,000. Finding new Chanel online is tough; you’ll want to hit a brick-and-mortar store for most purchases.

Maya Hawke, Tracee Ellis Ross, and Megan Fox have all been seen in Prada footwear. Prices range from $750 to $3,200 and can be found at Prada or via Bergdorf Goodman, Nordstrom, and more.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-stuart-weitzman></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Stuart Weitzman</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Designer Stuart Weitzman’s eponymous shoe company has been producing minimalist heels, sandals, and over-the-knee boots since 1986. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Nudist sandal is a longtime red carpet staple</a>, worn by celebs like Meghan Markle, Kim Kardashian, and Mindy Kaling, among others. and the brand’s stretchy, suede, over-the-knee boots are an off-duty favorite, spotted on Taylor Swift, Lily Aldrige, Selena Gomez, and more.

The Japanese sock-inspired, split-toe Tabi shoes went viral thanks to a dating nightmare shared on TikTok, but the “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ugly shoe</a>” has been a staple in various iterations on this designer brand’s runways since the late 1980s. In addition to that controversial style, the Replica sneakers were introduced on the runway in 1999, a low-top design inspired by standard-issue German Army Trainers. Design elements have changed over the years, but the distinctive label detail remains. Celebs like Dua Lipa, Zendaya, and Olivia Rodrigo have all been spotted in Margiela shoes.
