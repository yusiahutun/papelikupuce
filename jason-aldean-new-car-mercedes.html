I've been feeling guilty ever since I bought it," he admits.</p><p><strong>Meet Jason Aldean's 2020 Tourmate!</strong></p><p>Nobody is giving him a hard time about the pricetag but Aldean seems to be having buyer's remorse. Of course, it's not the only big-ticket item he's put down on lately, as he and wife Brittany Aldean are currently building a house that includes a swimming pool that would make a Las Vegas&nbsp;hotelier jealous. <a href=#>Pop Culture</a> also shares that the new pad will have a concrete safe room, spiral staircase and large outdoor porch. Mrs. Aldean's <a href=#>Instagram</a> is the place to see occasional photos of their new mansion.</p><p>Musically, Aldean just announced the 2020 <a href=#>We Back Tour </a>with Morgan Wallen and Riley Green. "We Back" is from his upcoming <a href=#>ninth studio album</a>, titled 9 and due to hit&nbsp;retailers on Nov. 22. The 2019 Ride All Night Tour rides through Oct. 11, and then he'll play a few shows in Las Vegas in December.</p><p><strong>Jason Aldean's Best Album Makes This List of the Century's Best</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo5mjpLturcudnJqmXaOyuHnCmqlmpZWnsKawxKxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./j-crew-goes-italian-lagerfelds-nude-shoot.html><span>←</span><span>J.Crew Goes Italian, Lagerfelds Nude Shoot?</span></a>
