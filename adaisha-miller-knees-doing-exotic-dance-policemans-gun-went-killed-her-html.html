she danced and touched his waistband.<br></span></p><p><span>Detroit officials reported that 24-year-old Adaisha Miller was performing some kind of 'exotic dance' that placed her in the line of fire for the holstered gun.<br></span></p><p><span>This theory contradicts the previous idea that she was hugging officer Isaac Parrish from behind when she was shot by a single bullet that went through her lung and heart.</span></p><p><span>The original story where Ms Miller was standing when she was shot left many with questions because that would not have explained how the angle of the bullet would have hit her from a holstered weapon.<br></span></p><p><span>Even though her mother initially said that her daughter could be 'being a little flirty' during the dance with the married officer, she is still not satisfied with the explanation that her daughter was on her knees at the time of her death.<br></span></p><p><span>'That's just not plausible,' Yolanda McNair, the victim's mother,

Godbee described Miller's death during a Monday news conference as a tragic, 'unfathomable' accident.<br></span></p><p><span>'Somehow, in the course of dancing with the individual to his rear and
