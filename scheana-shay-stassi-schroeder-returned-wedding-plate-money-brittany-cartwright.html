Brittany, 33, opened up about the ongoing drama while appearing on an episode of Scheana's podcast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Scheananigans with Scheana Shay"</a> earlier this month, and shared her side of the story.</p><p>While Scheana said Brittany's appearance on her podcast wasn't ill-intentioned, it ultimately "backfired" due to Stassi's response.</p><p>"The point of the podcast, honestly, was for [Stassi] to just understand Brittany’s side more because she wasn't taking her calls and Brittany messaged her so many times with no response," the reality star, 37, told Us. "We didn't do it maliciously or to talk s---. And then the backlash from it, it was, like, that actually wasn’t even the intention."</p><p>"We're like, 'Hopefully once [Stassi] hears this, she'll be like, 'Oh, my God, now I understand,'" Scheana added, before admitting that the podcast episode "backfired" on them. "Stassi sent the money back, Brittany had paid for the plates because she couldn't make it. And said 'Scheananigans podcast' [as the note]."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e3501684-4053-4ccb-a6e9-3395e6d135ca data-container-ref=toofab:article:0fc6ed1d-a5c9-4b54-98a0-ffd6732640d7 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1f/5by4/2022/06/14/1f1aede2282047d8b4bc5be115dbbc7a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Brittany Cartwright Reveals She & Stassi Schroeder Had Falling Out After She Didn't Attend Her Wedding</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In early May, Stassi, 33, and Beau tied the knot for the second time in Rome, Italy. Although Brittany and her husband Jax were invited, they didn't attend the nuptials. And despite some comments from Stassi, in which she slammed the couple, Brittany has stressed that she and Jax wanted to attend, but they weren't able to make it work due to several reasons out of their control.</p><p>During an appearance episode on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Betches Moms"</a> podcast last month, Brittany, who shares 1-year-old son Cruz with Jax, explained, "Cruz's passport didn’t come in [and] my mom had a death in the family and had to go home. I mean, there was actual things that happened right before the wedding that we actually couldn't make it to the wedding for those reasons."</p><p>The Bravo alum noted that she felt "terrible" having to cancel at "the last minute" and expressed her regret over "not being able to be there for someone who I really do think of as one of my best friends."</p><p>"I'm truly sorry. And I hope that one day, we'll be able to talk about this and figure it all out. Because I do want our kids to grow up together," Brittany added of Stassi, who shares daughter 1-year-old daughter Hartford with Beau.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:6c04b836-74f0-43bc-ba72-51cab7085ec4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0fc6ed1d-a5c9-4b54-98a0-ffd6732640d7 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fd/5by4/2022/04/12/fd3d4ea9ae97438b83a55bff066d55e6_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Lala Kent Reveals She 'Cut' Ties with This Pump Rules Costar for Hanging Out with Randall Emmett</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>During her appearance on "Scheananigans," Brittany shared more details about being forced to cancel on Stassi's wedding, as well as some drama involving some "rage" texts from her husband Jax.</p><p>The mom of one said Jax sent messages to a friend of Stassi and her husband-to-be "expressing his doubts" about whether he and Brittany would be attending the wedding. However, Brittany claimed she didn't "actually know what all of the text messages were" and "never sent any text messages" herself, adding, "I'll make that very clear, because I would never do that to them. I was planning on going 1000, 100 percent."</p><p>"Jax started getting in his head, getting worked up about flying with the baby," she added. "You know how Jax is, he'll just text and rage text ... He was expressing his doubts and that he didn't really think he wanted to go anymore."</p><p>Brittany said Jax "shouldn't have done it," admitting that she was "very upset" with her husband over the text messages.</p><p>She also noted that she "reached out" to Stassi since the wedding, but hadn't heard back. "I haven't gotten any response just yet," she shared. "I'll try again in a couple weeks or something. I don't know. I just like to make things right."</p><a id=gallery-link-e178d979-0c29-4d00-b3bb-d35d31b736cf class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:e178d979-0c29-4d00-b3bb-d35d31b736cf data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:0fc6ed1d-a5c9-4b54-98a0-ffd6732640d7 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/26/4by3/2021/08/09/2634f747464c44029e955fbed439b67f_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3Bma2hfqLCpscCnmGarmJbGbr%2FTmqqsoV2osKm%2Bzp6bnqpdp7K1wdGnnJ1lp5qxpbXNoGSppJGpsm65zqecsmWSp7a1wMCnsGabkafBuL7IoJ%2BtZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./local-events.html><span>←</span><span>Local Events | leader-call.com</span></a>
