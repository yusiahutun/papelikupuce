The husband and wife thereafter began their sentences in January at the prisons Florida’s Federal Prison Camp Pensacola and Kentucky’s Federal Medical Center in Lexington, respectively.</p><p style=text-align:left>Since then, the rest of the Chrisleys have been having just as tough times. While continuing to believe what they were accused of is wrong, the family members have been talking about their frustrations with the federal legal system and how their imprisonment has taken a toll on all of their lives. Yet, amid all this, one of the Chrisley, i.e., Lindsie Chrisley just made her relationship with her new boyfriend, <a href=#>Trent Weiser</a>, Instagram official. And so we thought we would introduce you to his family members as well.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Trent Weiser’s Family Members?</strong></h3><p>Trent Weiser in his family has his parents and a sibling. Moreover, in the past, he also had a wife, and with her, he shares two kids.</p><p>Trent’s ex-wife is <a href=#>Ashley Muir</a>. The two tied the knot on 23 November 2013 at Barnsley Resort in Adairsville, Georgia. Thereafter, one of them filed for divorce later in October 2022. But, today, on her Facebook, Ashley happens to mark her relationship status as “Divorced since November 23, 2013”. Why she did so, she did not reveal.</p><p>Just on 28 May 2023, Ashley took to her Facebook to tell people about how, 11 days before, she and her family escaped their family home and watched it burn to the ground in the middle of the night. This is the last time she mentioned her kids on a social media post. She explained how her 7-year-old daughter saved herself and her 5-year-old.</p><p>Ashley had further talked about her brother Joey saving her other brother, Matthew. She herself was laying inside a hyperbaric chamber on the fourth floor. Her dad had come to her in just minutes to spare. And so like that, the moment after everyone was out on the street, every room in the house was on fire. And fortunately, not only did they “miraculously” all live, they “escaped completely unharmed”.</p><h3><strong>Meet Teresa Weiser, Trent Weiser Mother</strong></h3><p>Trent’s mother is Teresa Smith Weiser, AKA Teresa Diane Weiser. She can be found on Facebook with the same name, where she just lately shared a comical clip from Golden Girls&nbsp;and had fun exchanging comments with her friends in the comment box.

William is actually also married to someone else called Evelyn Weiser.</p><p>So, this Evelyn, Trent’s stepmother, previously worked at a place called ‘honey creek hair’ and studied at North Idaho College. She turned 73 years old in September 2022.</p><h3><strong>How Many Siblings Does Trent Weiser Have?</strong></h3><p>Trent Weiser has just one sibling.
