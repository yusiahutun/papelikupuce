The beloved TV personality celebrated his 40th year with NBC News in December 2018.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“From the moment I stepped foot in WKYC in Cleveland to getting a job at WNBC, I thought I’d died and gone to heaven because my parents could actually turn on the TV and see me, to being here with all of you, it’s been an amazing ride,” the newscaster said during an episode of </span><i><span>Today </span></i><span>commemorating his achievement.</span></p><p><span>Along with his work in the news field, Al has </span><a href=#><span>authored several books</span></a><span>, including 2016’s </span><i><span>The Storm of the Century</span></i><span> and 2020’s </span><i><span>You Look So Much Better in Person</span></i><span>.

On Instagram, he revealed he was going through a health battle that </span><a href=#><span>left him in the hospital</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“So many of you have been thoughtfully asking where I’ve been. Last week I was admitted to the hospital with a blood clot in my leg which sent some clots into my lungs,” he captioned a post on November 18, 2022. “After some medical whack-a-mole, I am so fortunate to be getting terrific medical care and on the way to recovery. Thanks for all the well wishes and prayers and hope to see you soon. Have a great weekend, everyone.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Al-Roker-Net-Worth-How-Much-Money-‘Today-Host-Makes-1.jpg><p><span>Al did tune in to watch his costars host the parade, with </span><b>Dylan Dreyer</b><span> filling in for him during the broadcast.
