First up was a turn on the latest attraction atop Rockefeller Center: the Beam. In some of the images, the two can be seen sitting on a metal beam, made to resemble the construction site captured in the famous 1932 photo&nbsp;Lunch Atop a Skyscraper, per <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Curbed</a>. Another slide showed a selfie of the two on the roof deck with the NYC skyline as the backdrop.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They also made a visit to the renowned Katz Delicatessen (where David enjoyed a massive sandwich), and the father-daughter duo posed in front of the tree at Rockefeller, a staple of New York's holiday decorations. In the sweet snap, David kissed Harper's cheek in front of the famed sparkling pine.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>David Beckham/Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later, they made their way down to the rink to do some skating, and one photo captured David putting on Harper's skate for her.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Fun few days in NYC üá∫üá∏ #HarperSeven ‚ù§Ô∏è," David captioned the roundup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The trip wasn't all father-daughter quality time, however.
