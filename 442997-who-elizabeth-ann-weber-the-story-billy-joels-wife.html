She prefers to keep her matters private.</p><p class=align-left>She attended private school and later joined New York University for her advanced studies. Elizabeth earned some remarkable managerial skills from the university.</p><h2>Elizabeth Weber and Billy Joel</h2><p class=align-left>The most exciting thing about Billy and Elizbeth's relationship is that it had a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">scandalous start</a>. They started dating when Elizabeth was married to Jon Small.</p><p class=align-left>It all started in 1967 when the legendary <a href=#>musician</a> Billy Joel joined the <a href=#>Hassles rock group</a>, where he met drummer, Jon Smalls. Jon and Billy would later leave the band to form their own Attila. And it was during this time Elizabeth started having an affair with Joel.</p><p class=align-left>Billy Joel recounted <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">his first encounter</a> with Elizabeth to Fred Schruers:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/12aa27019e1c27f6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Felicia Forbes: The story of Tommy 'Tiny' Lister's wife</span></p></a>She wasn’t like a lot of the other girls I knew at that time who had taken home ec and cooking classes. She was...intelligent and not afraid to speak her mind but could also be seductive. Almost like a European-type — not a typical American girl.<p class=align-left>And as most affairs, Elizabeth and Jon's was discovered, causing their musical partnership to end and a split of the band. But, on the other hand, Elizabeth took an unexpected move after being found out. She chose to stay away from both men and disappeared for weeks.</p><p class=align-left>Her disappearance took a tremendous toll on Billy. Elizabeth leaving and the failure of both of his albums made him suicidal. Fortunately, Elizabeth Ann Weber came back, and the pair married in September 1973.</p><p class=align-left>After the two became a pair, Ann was assigned Billy's finance manager, which allowed her to manage all his <a href=#>business</a> deals and contracts.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/056aed0e13bc2a47.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Maria Aquinar: What you should know about Sebastian Bach's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, Elizabeth and Billy filed for divorce in 1982. And as the relationship started, the separation was one to write about. Billy tried as much as he could to <a href=#>save the relationship</a> and even agreed to buy Elizabeth everything she wanted, including a $4 million mansion on the Upper East Side. But, unfortunately, the relationship never got better, and the two finalized their divorce.</p><h2>Elizabeth was the inspiration for some of Billy's songs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e3a0ccbb28be263d.jpg><p class=align-left>Despite their less than a decade union, Elizabeth and Billy's love appeared profound as <a href=#>the musician</a> composed various songs inspired by his wife. These songs include <i>Just The Way You Are, She Got a Way, </i>and<i> She's Always a Woman.</i></p><h2>Elizabeth had a great affinity for money</h2><p class=align-left>Elizabeth showed a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">great financial desire</a> when he was with Billy differently. She was never shy of asking for her financial gain from the songs that her husband penned down for her. Elizabeth even requested publishing rights for the song <i>Just The Way You Are</i>, which was once played during her birthday.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/86c034403557e484.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Annie D'Angelo: What you should know about Willie Nelson's spouse</span></p></a><h2>Elizabeth’s controversies</h2><p class=align-left>One of the most significant controversies about Elizabeth Ann Weber was her management techniques when she oversaw Billy's business finances. Some claimed that Ann was manipulative and controlling.</p><p class=align-left>According to Billy, one of the biggest mistakes was allowing Ann's brother, Frank, into his establishment. Frank took the role of Joel's manager and would manage his finances. However, the funniest thing is that Frank took Joel's side during the divorce and continued to work for him even after the separation.</p><p class=align-left>But things were not as great as they seemed, as Joel later discovered that Frank, Elizabeth's brother, was stealing millions of dollars from him. And this resulted in Joel suing Frank for $30 million in 1989 in contemporary damages and $60 million in punitive damages. However, the case never happened as Frank filed for bankruptcy, resulting in an out-of-court settlement of $3 million.</p><h2>Where is Elizabeth Ann Weber now?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/04b2eb22ed8c0c79.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Anna Woolhouse's age, married, boxing, career, family, facts</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7e05b3268adef167.jpg><p class=align-left>Ann was married to Billy more than four decades ago.

Considering her low profile and the many years that have gone by, her whereabouts are unknown. There is hardly any journalist following up on her hence the absence of stories about her progress since then.
