You can track a package or shipment using two methods. Here is a look at each method.</p><h3>Track Posta parcels and shipments online</h3><p class=align-left>The Posta tracking service is <a href=#>available online</a>. It offers the fastest way of determining the location of your shipment. Furthermore, it gives you complete tracking information, including the office from which the parcel originated. You will also view the location of your shipment and the destination. To track your shipment:</p><ul><li>Ensure you have a shipment ID. Your shipment ID is on the receipt you received when booking for shipment.</li><li>Go to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Posta tracking website</a>.</li><li>Enter your shipment ID in the space provided.</li><li>Your shipment ID is 13 characters long.</li><li>Press enter to get your shipment’s tracking information.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fc50e4344fd91823.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to book an appointment at Huduma center in a few simple steps</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9a90082494fa5b41.jpg><p class=align-left>The information displayed will include the current location of your parcel. In addition, PCK keeps the tracking information for the next 120 days, even after the corporation has delivered your shipment. That will make it easier for you to refer to the information in case of disputes.</p><h3>Track Posta parcel through email</h3><p class=align-left>You can also track your parcel or shipment via email. That means you will have to contact Posta by sending an email. Here is what to do:</p><ul><li>Send an email to customerservice@posta.co.ke.</li><li>Provide your shipment ID.</li><li>Wait for Posta to reply.</li></ul><p class=align-left>PCK will reply with all the information you need about your shipment.</p><p class=align-left>Once your Posta delivers your item, it will send you an SMS or Email notification.
