The energy was contagious — even judges <a href=#>Katy Perry</a> and <a href=#>Luke Bryan </a>were&nbsp;seen nodding along&nbsp;in their seats, and the young singer earned a standing ovation from all three judges at the end of the song.</p><p>During the feedback portion of Stough’s time on stage, Perry kicked things off by applauding the confidence it took to cover “Midnight Rider.” She admitted wanting a little more “attack” from the young hopeful, but wrapped things up by saying Stough sounded “great as always.”</p><p>Bryan echoed Perry’s sentiment, telling Stough to get into the performances a little more and add movement instead of standing in one spot behind the microphone. He encouraged Stough to do “what the music and your vibe tells you to do” and to continue to work toward being fully comfortable on stage.</p><p>Richie at first struggled with an eloquent way to verbalize what he was looking for in future performances, before telling Stough to get “nasty” with it,&nbsp;lean into the music and letting go of everything else.</p><p>Stough will have a chance to get "nasty" with another performance. At the end of Sunday night's show it was announced that he had earned enough votes to advance into the Top 10.</p><p>American Idol airs on Sunday and Monday nights at 8PM ET on ABC.</p><p><strong>See American Idol Contestants Then and Now</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnKecnrtuv9OorKCgXZa6pr7InJinZZmZvK1506inZmlgYrqqsM2inqGsXae2pbHRZq2inJWkfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lexi2legit.html><span>←</span><span>Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Facts, Nationality</span></a>
