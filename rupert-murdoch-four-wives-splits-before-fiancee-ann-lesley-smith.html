"So I speak Rupert's language. We share the same beliefs."</p><p id=eBI8ruuXzIK data-wc=54>Ann met Rupert at his vineyard Moraga in Bel Air in September 2022. "She and her husband also owned a vineyard and had been in the wine business. Last year when there was 200 people at my vineyard, I met her and we talked a bit. Two weeks later I called her," he explained.</p><p id=eWx09meIBJG data-wc=65>Following a whirlwind relationship, Rupert popped the question on St Patrick's Day with an Asscher-cut diamond solitaire engagement ring. "I was very nervous. I dreaded falling in love — but I knew this would be my last. It better be. I’m happy," he added. Not anymore. According to Rupert had become "uncomfortable with Smith’s outspoken evangelical views," which helped lead to their split.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Why did Rupert Murdoch and Jerry Hall split?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/7f85557258d3-rupert-murdoch-wedding-jerry-hall-z.jpg><p id=e26u0bjwoJaI data-wc=18>The media mogul had only finalised his divorce from actor Jerry Hall in 2022 following a six-year marriage.</p><p id=eYEv9WLcXLDu data-wc=33>They were first spotted in public attending the Rugby World Cup in 2015, before getting married in London in 2016 and Rupert stating he was "the luckiest AND happiest man in the world."</p><p id=egM__v0nT33- data-wc=30>In 2022, their representatives confirmed in a joint statement: "Jerry and Rupert Murdoch have finalised their divorce.

"I began to think the Rupert Murdoch that I loved died a long time ago. Perhaps I was in love with the idea of still being in love with him. But the Rupert I fell in love with could not have behaved this way," she said, before adding: "I think that Rupert's affair with Wendi Deng – it's not an original plot – was the end of the marriage. His determination to continue with that. I thought we had a wonderful, happy marriage. Obviously, we didn't."&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Why did Rupert Murdoch and Patricia Booker split?</h2><p id=eiSXobxEo2Ya data-wc=32>Rupert's first marriage was to flight attendant Patricia Brooker.
