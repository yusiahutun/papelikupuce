The act has long been taboo as far as American culture is concerned. It's rarely depicted in TV or movies beyond women rolling over in bed and complaining of cramps. The infamous "tampon scene" was cut from the first Fifty Shades of Grey film (where Christian Grey removes Anastasia Steele's tampon before having sex), to which director Sam Taylor-Thompson says the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/entertainment/movies/Fifty-Shades-of-Grey-wont-include-infamous-tampon-scene.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="scene was never even discussed" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">scene was never even discussed</a>. Sex and blood don't mix in Hollywood, but what about in the real world? In honor of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/period-menstruation-facts/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="period month" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">period month</a>, we polled a few women and men for their honest take on the deed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I think <strong>it's extremely healthy to have sex on your period</strong>. It's totally natural and actually, just a different albeit enjoyable experience. As for us moody gals suffering from PMS, sex can help with that too." —29, female, DJ</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I opt out of sex for the first few days of heavy bleeding, just because sex is the very last thing on my mind. My partner wouldn't mind, <strong>I'm just not feeling my hottest</strong>. " 27, female, marketing manager</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Yes, I definitely do. <strong>I feel more aroused during my period</strong> sometimes. Currently I am dating a woman, so I am less self conscious about having period sex because I know that she is not turned off by it and it can be quite enjoyable." —31, female, stylist</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"No, <strong>I'm a germaphobe</strong>, I don't have sex on my period." —32, female, event planner<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I generally don't because it's a pain in the ass, but that's purely out of laziness. My partner doesn't care at all—he's European and thinks <strong>Americans can be ridiculously puritanical about bodily functions</strong>." —31, female, writer</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"<strong>Two words: shower sex</strong>. I don't normally have sex when it's day one or two of a heavy period but when it's light—fair game. A real man doesn't mind a little blood in the mix but no one wants it to be a murder scene." —31, female, music director</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Depends on how well I know the partner. Some guys don't care but some are not into it. My last experience with a guy I had been dating for about two months did try to make me feel bad after we had sex while I was on my period (we were both heading out of town and it was our last chance for a while). A spot happened to get on his sheets and he repeatedly brougth it up. <strong>I don't need a guy making me feel embarrassed for being a woman</strong>." — 30, female, designer</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I'm totally indifferent. I could do it or could not do it—but I don't think about it. If a girl is on her period, though, she should definitely give the guy a choice: 1) it's messy, and 2) <strong>some dudes aren't into it</strong>. More often than not though, I'd rather wait and do it after her period is over, or very light, but that's because I'm in a relationship." —30, male, photographer</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"If I found myself in this situation, which I have maybe once or twice, chances are I have been with the girl for a bit and I like her. If we are in the heat of the moment and she is ok with it, then <strong>I'm not going to let a little death juice ruin the mood</strong>. Roll out the tarp like a Dexter crime scene." —31, male, broker</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"No, I'm not into it. As a guy, <strong>a girl's period is a messy mystery</strong>. Guys don't understand it and usually don't want to understand it. We don't want our girlfriends or wives to keep secrets from us, but this is one that they can keep. Separately, I think when it comes to sex, guys generally tend to be more superficial and focus on the physical aspect of the act. Aesthetics of the experience matters and period sex affects that experience." —30, male, banker</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"<strong>It doesn't make a difference to me</strong>." —31, male, sports recruiter</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It depends on the partner and where in the cycle—usually avoid it during the peak because of the mess. But honestly it doesn't really bother me. The biggest deal is tell your partner. <strong>The last thing a guy wants is to be down there and figure it out for himself</strong>. That's an instant mood-killer for me. I had a one night stand in a hotel room once with somebody who didn't think I needed to know that she was in the heaviest part of her cycle. I realized something wasn't right and went to the bathroom... after turning the lights on, it literally looked like somebody had been murdered. Not okay!" —26, male, music engineer</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Absolutely no objection to it. If you're a guy who is uptight about it maybe look in the mirror because <strong>your dingle-berry prone hairy man ass is grosser than anything natural coming out of your loved one's vagina</strong>. My partner doesn't get her period anymore (due to science, not age) and if she was worried I would do my best to make her comfortable. Feeling at ease in the bedroom translates to more fun there and better emotional health elsewhere."—31, male, music marketing</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/6596416d-7fe0-4447-a1bb-29857d998209_1532371556.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chrissy Rutherford" title="Headshot of Chrissy Rutherford" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Chrissy Rutherford is a contributing editor at HarpersBazaar.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGielZbBtr7ErGaaaWBlgHqFlXBmqZ2inryledKer2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./futbol-internacional.html><span>←</span><span>Jrgen Damm: &amp;quot;Ojal pronto supere a Gareth Bale&amp;quot;</span></a>
