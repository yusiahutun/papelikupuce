However, this only scratches the surface of the song's true meaning. Throughout the track, Wilson sings of a woman who has been hardened by past romantic relationships that haven't lived up to her standards and she's learned a lot about relationships that she wants her future partner to know. In a recent interview with according to <a href=#>CMT's Cody Alan</a>, Wilson revealed that at the heart of the lyrics is the message that a man should have "good character."</p><p>"It's not about if you can change a tire or start a fire. It's about having a good character," she explained. "It's about treating people the way you want to be treated.&nbsp;It's just about the golden rule, 'being kind.'"</p><p>The chorus of the song allows this hidden meaning to shine through. Wilson says that what a man oughta know is,&nbsp;"How to know when it's love / How to stay when it's tough / How to know you're messin' up a good thing / And how to fix it 'fore it's too late." She adds, "And yeah, I know a boy / Who gave up and got it wrong / If you really love a woman, you don't let her go."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWpkaYJ2e9OhnGasoqqybrnEmqWippdir6a0yKebZqyYnruov4yaZKaZnmK8trPHrZhmo56kxG6u2GajmqGemsZuw8ilqqimXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./olivia-wilde-risque-dress-cowboys-and-aliens-premiere-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Olivia Wilde's Risque Red Carpet Look</span></a>
