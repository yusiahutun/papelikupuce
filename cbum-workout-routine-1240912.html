So, in this article, we will discuss various aspects of his lifestyle because although constructing a physique deserving of such accolades may not be your goal, the discipline, hard work, and dedication that CBum displays in his life may offer you an inspiration to follow your own fitness journey.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Who is Chris Bumstead?</strong></h2><p>Christopher Adam Bumstead, affectionately known as CBum by his fans, is a professional bodybuilder from Canada affiliated with the IFBB. Born on February 2, 1995, in Ottawa, Ontario, Bumstead grew up in a sporting environment. During his high school years, he engaged in various sports, such as fencing, football, baseball, basketball, and hockey.&nbsp;</p><p>Chris Bumstead’s weightlifting journey started at the early age of 14 when he started working out extensively and went from 170 to 225 pounds. As Bumstead's aspirations in bodybuilding began to escalate, his sister's boyfriend, Iain Valliere, recognized his potential and provided guidance for his various competitions. There he unexpectedly found himself securing high rankings, even placing second at the prestigious Olympia event. Bumstead's journey in bodybuilding commenced with a regional-level competition in Ontario, which he entered alongside his sister, Melissa Valliere. To their delight, both emerged victorious, with Bumstead achieving the junior category win. This experience deepened his passion for bodybuilding, leading him to collaborate directly with Iain and dedicate himself fully to the sport.</p><p>In 2014, at the age of 19, Bumstead debuted in competitive bodybuilding. At 21, he earned his IFBB professional status after clinching victory at the 2016 IFBB North American Bodybuilding Championship. His inaugural appearance at the Mr. Olympia event in 2017 left a remarkable impression, securing him second place in the Classic Physique category. In 2018, he retained his Mr. Olympia title despite the setback he faced when he was hospitalized four weeks prior to the competition due to severe water retention stemming from kidney issues. His physical condition was less optimal but he continued with his training.</p><p>Bumstead's global recognition soared as he clinched the title of Mr. Olympia consecutively in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. These victories established him as the reigning champion in the Men's Classic Physique division, solidifying his place in bodybuilding history.</p><h2><strong>What is CBum's Workout Split?</strong></h2><p>Bumstead's training program often revolves around a traditional 5-day training split targeting different muscle groups on different days. This split allows for adequate rest time while ensuring each muscle group is targeted regularly. A common split might look like this:</p><li>Chest workouts</li><li>Triceps</li><li>Back and biceps</li><li>Legs</li><li>Shoulders and traps</li><li>Rest day or active recovery</li><li>Arms and abs</li><li>Rest day</li><h2><strong>What is the CBum Workout Routine? (Weekly)</strong></h2><p>Chris Bumstead's training philosophy centers around the idea of developing a classic, balanced physique with an emphasis on proportionality and aesthetics. He aims to achieve a sculpted look that harkens back to the <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","The CBum Workout Routine to be Sculpted Like a Bodybuilder","1240912","https://www.pinkvilla.com/health/diet/30-day-shred-diet-1239806","articlepage","/health/fitness/cbum-workout-routine-1240912","physique ideals","Body_Hyperlink","health","fitness")'>physique ideals</a> of bodybuilders from the 1960s and 1970s. He reportedly does not always have a rigid regime, allowing for slight exercise adjustments. Nonetheless, his training framework remains remarkably steady. Bumstead's daily workouts are curated to fit in fundamental exercises, employing a mix of free weights and specialized machines. This also typically consists of compound exercises that build a strong foundation of muscle mass, followed by isolation exercises to focus on specific muscle groups. Here's a sample workout program for Chris Bumstead's specific workouts:</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h3><strong>Chest:</strong></h3><li>Smith Machine Bench Press (4 sets x 6-8 reps)</li><li>Incline Dumbbell Press (4 sets x 8-10 reps)</li><li>Chest Dips (3 sets x 10-12 reps)</li><li>Cable Fly or Incline Dumbell Fly (3 sets x 12-15 reps)</li><h3><strong>Triceps:</strong></h3><li>Close-Grip Bench Dips (4 sets x 8-10 reps)</li><li>Skull Crushers (3 sets x 10-12 reps)</li><li>Tricep Pushdowns (3 sets x 12-15 reps)</li><li>Overhead Tricep Extension (3 sets x 10-12 reps)</li><h3><strong>Leg workout </strong><strong>(Quads and calf):</strong></h3><li>Leg Extension (Drop Set): 2 sets x 20 reps</li><li>Smith Machine Squat: 2 sets x 6-10 reps</li><li>Leg Tri Set:</li><p>- Unilateral Leg Press: 3 sets x 8-10 reps</p><p>- Sissy Squat: 3 sets x 12-15 reps</p><p>- Seated Calf Raise: 3 sets x 10-12 reps</p><h3><strong>Back workout:</strong></h3><li>Close Grip Underhand Lat Pulldown: 3 sets x 10-12 reps</li><li>Chest Supported Dumbbell Row: 2 sets x 8-10 reps</li><li>Chest Supported T-Bar Row (Drop Set): 2 sets x 8-10 reps</li><li>Machine Row: 2 sets x 10-12 reps</li><li>Cable Lat Extension: 2 sets x 10-12 reps</li><h3><strong>Shoulder workout</strong><strong>:</strong></h3><li>Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press: 2 sets x 6-10 reps</li><li>Machine Shoulder Press (Drop Set): 3 sets x 6-10 reps</li><li>Seated Dumbbell Lateral Raise (Drop Set): 2 sets x 8-10 reps</li><li>Machine Lateral Raise 2 sets x 10-12 reps</li><li>Reverse Pec Deck: 2 sets x 10-12 reps</li><h3><strong>Arms:</strong></h3><li>Rope Cable Triceps Pressdown (Drop Set): 2 sets x 8-10 reps</li><li>Incline Dumbbell Skull Crusher: 2 sets x 8-10 reps</li><li>EZ Bar Preacher Curl (Drop Set): 3 sets x 8-10 reps</li><li>Dumbbell Curl: 2 sets x 10-12 reps</li><li>Cable Cross Body Triceps: 2 sets x 10-15 reps</li><li>Low Pulley Cable Curl with V-Bar Handle (Drop Set): 2 sets x 10-12 reps</li><p>Remember, the specific exercises, sets, and reps can vary based on individual preferences, experience, and goals.
