Period. Maybe it was Jessica Batten's loss. But, maybe there's more to dig in that Netflix didn't show.</p><p>Our heart still breaks at the sight of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Mark Cuevas</strong></a> crying at the wedding venue after being dumped by former fiancee <strong>Jessica Batten</strong>. But, our heart also smiles at the rejection that saved both of their lives from being ruined. Mark was ready to move mountains for Jessica. But, sadly, the only issue was he fell head over heels in love with the wrong person.</p><h2>Mark Cuevas Netflix's Love Is Blind Journey</h2><p>As the viewers watched Love Is blind, a reality dating show where contestants intend to find their soulmate without ever facing them and builds a bond based on their emotional attachment, <strong>Mark Cuevas</strong>, from the beginning, had an emotional connection with only one woman among all the ladies he interacted inside the pod, and it was <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jessica Batten</strong></a>.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/03/04/mark-cuevas-and-jessica-batten-became-engaged-at-love-is-blind--1583324505.png width=450 height=338 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Mark Cuevas and Jessica batten became engaged at Love Is Blind. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Business Insider</span></strong><p>Poor Mark, what he didn't know was the fact that the woman he had been crushing over the moon had confused feelings between two men. Long story short, Miss Batten liked another man, fellow contestant <strong>Matt Barnett</strong> who ironically liked another woman, <strong>Amber Pike</strong>. Jeez, the love triangle!</p><p>But Jessica should be applauded for her honesty and clearing out the misunderstanding with Mark that she doesn't love him. Karma is a b*tch, though. Jessica then rejects Mark only to be ultimately rejected by Matt who proposes Pike. What happens next? It's sort of embarrassing and unfair to Mark that Jessica runs back to him who later accepts her. The show also co-starring <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Cameron Hamilton</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Lauren Speed</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Damian Powers</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Giannina Gibelli</strong></a> is honestly super crazy.</p><p>Good for Jessica, the <a href=# rel=noopener>fitness pro who bags an impressive wealth</a> forgives her and becomes ready to start everything all over again. Maybe love is indeed blind! And, from everything we watched, the fans never held back from crucifying Jessica for playing with Mark's feelings when she was still clearly in love with another lady's man.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/03/04/mark-anthony-was-rejected-by-fiancee-jessica-batten-at-the-altar--1583314948.jpg width=450 height=236 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Mark Anthony and former fiancee Jessica Batten. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Honk News</span></strong><p>Not to mention, how she still tried to flirt with Matt on their romantic vacation to Mexico. Surprisingly, she even called it a red flag for Mark being too emotionally available. On top of it all, Jessica who is obsessed with their age difference of ten years even moans over Mark's height? We mean he is taller than her?</p><h2>When Jessica Complained Mark Cuevas Height; Behind The Drama&nbsp;</h2><p>Jessica is really the one to say a word when she should have been thankful for Mark. Like we mentioned, Batten once also complained over Cuevas height for being short. And, this brought a lot of curiosity among Love Is Blind's fans over the Atlanta native's body measurement.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/03/04/mark-cuevas-and-jessica-batten-on-their-wedding-day--1583314768.jpg width=450 height=253 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Mark Cuevas and Jessica Batten at the altar where they couldn't get married. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Pop Sugar</span></strong><p>Well, Mark Cuevas who flaunts hot abs stands at a height of five feet nine inches. But, since the other men in the show were apparently taller, Mark comparatively looked shorter. And, moving the attention from Mark's height, there's also more to the drama that Netflix didn't like their viewers to find out.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/03/05/mark-cuevas-who-stands-at-a-height-of-5-feet-9-inches-seen-alongside-damian-powers-and-cameron-hamilton--1583390978.jpg width=450 height=538 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Mark Cuevas who stands at a height of 5 feet 9 inches seen alongside Damian Powers and Cameron Hamilton. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Mark Cuevas Instagram</span></strong><p>Apparently, after facing rejection from Matt, it's been reported that Jessica wanted to pack up and leave the show behind and go back home. Netflix didn't allow her to. She was, however, allowed to quit Love Is Blind on only one condition - if she pays the price of <strong>$500,000</strong>. If this is true then, it explains everything.</p><p>Remember how Jessica tried to get closer to Matt at the party whilst her fiance was just a few meters away and even met him secretly a few days before her wedding? And, when she entered the altar solo by herself with no bridesmaids, we should have known things were about to go down. Poor Mark, the inevitable happened. She dumped him in front of everyone. Mark and Jessica couldn't get married.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Fast forward today, nearly two years since Love Is Blind wrapped up, Mark and Jessica never met each other till the Love Is Blind reunion happened, as the personal trainer claimed in an interview with TMZ. It also seems as he is currently single. However, as for Jessica, she moved on but didn't date anyone for a long time.</p><p>See more <a href=# rel=noopener>Stories</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Biographies</a> only on <a href=# rel=noopener>Marriedwiki.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK57wKuropucmnyurdGkZJytlauutHnFq6amZZ6awae4yLFkpaemmnqqv4ybo6KmlGKxpr%2FEq62enF2XsrXAxKtksKCRqXq4sc2tZLCqn6O0bsPIrZ9mopWowKqvwGaZmqykmrs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-met-gala-hair-price-tag-revealed.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian's Met Gala ponytail's price tag revealed you may need to sit down</span></a>
