And who doesn't love a good Moda Operandi buy? So what happens when these two come together? One epic resale … sale.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Moda Operandi and Rebag are partnering today on a digital trunk show that gives access to more than 115 of the secondary market site's most in-demand styles. Those bags include limited-edition offerings of exotic one-of-a-kind pieces by names including Hermès, Chanel, Dior, and Vuitton, chosen by Moda Operandi's buyers from Rebag's inventory of 30,000 pieces. The sale will, as Charles Gorra, founder and CEO of Rebag, tells BAZAAR.com, "establish awareness [of Rebag] … and legitimization of resale behavior."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This meeting of two markets is notable, as more often than not, the resale market has been presented as existing at odds with the luxury space. "Now we're in a new world where everyone understands resale is becoming ubiquitous. … We've been around now over six years … and so I think that has provided a lot of time and a lot of conversation with retailers, with brands. … Behaviors are changing, mentalities are changing, and so everyone is adapting," Gorra says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gorra sees this melding with Moda Operandi as just the tip of the iceberg for one-off sales like this in the future. "You think about what retail is going to be in the next five or 10 years, everyone knows there's going to be more resale, and that resale and retail will have some synergy. … It's probably the beginning of what you're going to see a lot more in the coming months," he continues.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's become more and more evident that the same woman preordering her next-season wares from places like Moda Operandi, or Saks, or Net-a-Porter is the same luxury shopper perusing resale sites like Rebag or The RealReal. The trick, of course, is in finding that woman wherever she is shopping. "Moda Operandi brings its customers the best product, the most curated, luxurious assortment. And what we do is that through resale," Gorra explains. "We have access to premium pieces and exceptional items, especially in certain brands or categories she [the Moda shopper] is very well aware of—Hermès, Chanel, and others—that these days can be very hard to find in stores. And so, the exciting piece for Moda customers here will be how does Rebag bring to their platform some iconic, hard-to-find pieces through the lens of retail?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Shop some of the very chic answers to that question below and on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.modaoperandi.com/moda-archive-x-rebag-fw22 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Moda Operandi" data-vars-ga-product-id=47225c34-e523-4453-b5f2-da950de94849 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=http://www.modaoperandi.com/moda-archive-x-rebag-fw22 data-product-url=http://www.modaoperandi.com/moda-archive-x-rebag-fw22 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.modaoperandi.com%2Fmoda-archive-x-rebag-fw22" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=modaoperandi.com data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=5b1e3332-775e-4e16-ad5d-9716fd729c46 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=modaoperandi.com class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Moda Operandi</a> beginning at 11 a.m. today before they sell out.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/89754333-a030-4699-b9fa-0dfa137fc094_1496780517.jpg alt="Headshot of Kerry Pieri" title="Headshot of Kerry Pieri" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Kerry Pieri is Harper's Bazaar's Digital Fashion/Features Director.
