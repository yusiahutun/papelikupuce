But the <a href=#>celebrity</a> isn’t having it.

They then relocated to Florida when she was only eight years old. Although, in previous interviews, Millie Bobby Brown has managed to keep her British accent. But in a recent appearance, fans picked up the <a href=#>movie</a> star’s changing voice and were not impressed.</p><p>After receiving backlash for talking ‘differently’, she addressed it on <a href=#>TikTok</a>.</p><p>The <a href=#>Netflix</a> star said: “I’m an actor.</p><p>“I grew up in the public eye. I grew up in America.”</p><p>She added: “I come to set and I’m an actor and I adapt, and so I want to mimic other people!”</p><p id=eKOb3yCWwR>“I can’t help that when I’m around my fiancé, or when I’m with people like Jimmy Fallon who have a very American accent, I wanna replicate it!</p><p id=eOyg6nTPQI>“And now I’m in England, I wanna replicate that [accent]! I don’t do it intentional.”&nbsp;</p><p>She then looked directly at the camera and concluded: “I’m sorry if it offends you, okay? But listen, I’m trying my best! I’m trying my best.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-ate-and-left-no-crumbs>She ‘ate and left no crumbs’</h2><p>Fans are defending the star, especially seeing her passionate speech.</p><p>Her brand, Florence by Mills, commented: “Ate and left no crumbs,” while someone else highlighted other stars do it so it shouldn’t be a problem if Millie Bobbi Brown’s accent changes. They said: “Pedro Pascal does it. He’s not live in the UK to my knowledge and he often mimics the UK accent in interviews! Whether it’s a comfort thing or acting thing it shouldn’t matter!”</p><p>A second added: “People also forget she spent so much of her childhood and teenage hood playing and living as an American character her own age”.</p><p>And a third continued: “She code-switches (I don’t know if that’s the correct term in this case but everyone does this when you have an accent.</p><p>“If you live in a country for so long, you start to adapt like she said, to that language”.</p><p>While a fourth wanted to compliment the star: “I truly think Millie is such a sweet person in real life”.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2WGcLnIpaOinV2XvKOu2GaZq6eno3qptdOsZJuZk6B6osCMn5inq12ks6exzZ2cnWWSrnqpsdFmmqGZnpy2r7OMmpqcnZ6pfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./435540-frederick-heschel-bialik-stone-5-facts-mayim-bialiks-son.html><span>←</span><span>Frederick Heschel Bialik Stone: 5 facts about Mayim Bialik's son</span></a>
