At the end of the day, it’s been cool to watch for me because, obviously he has all that attention but he’s just been himself the whole time.</p><p>“He’s still Travis Kelce. He’ll still walk through the stadium and treat every single person like they’re his best friend, and he’s going to be like that in the locker room every single day,” the 28-year-old continued.</p><p>Mahomes then continues to praise the “great players” on his team, including his friend Travis. He then went on to talk about the 34-year-old’s SNL performance and explained it had always been a dream of his.</p><p>“He crushed it, man. That’s something that hopefully longer down the line he’ll be able to do more of that type of stuff.”</p><p>It seems Kelce’s newfound fame hasn’t changed him off the field either, as he scored <a href=#>two epic touchdowns</a> against the Buffalo Bills last weekend.</p><p>The win meant the Chiefs are only one win away from a place in this year’s Super Bowl if they beat the Baltimore Ravens tonight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1915662868-1024x700.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-patrick-mahomes-sr-calls-taylor-swift-down-to-earth>Patrick Mahomes Sr. calls Taylor Swift ‘down to earth’</h2><p>It’s not just the Chiefs player who’s a fan of the two, together, it looks like his dad is too, as he told a cute anecdote during an appearance on WFAN Sports Radio’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Evan & Tiki </a>show on Thursday.</p><p>Recalling the first time he met the <a href=#>music</a> star, Pat said Swift was “very nice and genuine” and said she was “very down to earth.”</p><p>“Someone that’s famous, you never know how that’s going to go,” he added, before recalling how Swift recognized him from <a href=#>Netflix</a>‘s Quarterback documentary.</p><p>He also explained how she made his daughter, &nbsp;Zoe Mahomes’ day by taking a picture with her. Honestly, that would make our year!</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2eFcMDRmq2iq12gsq2vxGagrGWknbJuv8CmnGafpa56qrqMrZ%2BeZZyksKyx0WapqKedYq6nwMSrZJ2ZpJ67qHnTmrClp6JiwLi1xa1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ayr-black-friday-cyber-monday-2023.html><span>←</span><span>The Best AYR Black Friday Sale 2023 Deals to Shop</span></a>
