His ever-evolving looks left a lasting impact on fashion and grooming trends. In this exploration of Elvis Presley's hairstyles, we will delve into the evolution of his hair throughout his illustrious career. From the youthful pompadour that first captured hearts to the later, more elaborate styles, we will uncover the significance of Elvis's hair choices in the context of his extraordinary life and their enduring influence on pop culture. Elvis's hairstyles are more than just a visual journey; they are a testament to his legacy.</p><h2 id=6579bdefb3a6b><strong>10 </strong><strong>Elvis Presley Hairstyles That Defines “Iconic”</strong></h2><h3 id=6579bdefb3a74><strong>1. Messy Pompadour&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><img alt="Elvis presley hairstyles" title="Elvis presley hairstyles" width=1000 height=667 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-10/1697606864_shutterstock_1021242310-1.jpg></p><p>Elvis’s youthful pompadour, a symbol of rock ‘n’ roll rebellion, was accentuated by his blond hair. To achieve this look, maintain longer hair on top while keeping the sides shorter. Regularly comb the top hair back, creating volume and height. To perfect the signature slick appearance, use a strong-hold pomade that ensures the hair remains in place, giving it that iconic rockabilly style. Finish it off with a blast of hair spray for that authentic blonde hair that stays put.</p><h3 id=6579bdefb3a80><strong>2. Ducktail</strong></h3><p><img alt="Elvis presley hairstyles" title="Elvis presley hairstyles" width=1000 height=667 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-10/1697606865_shutterstock_1092972470-1.jpg></p><p>The ducktail hairstyle exudes rugged charm. To attain this look, maintain shorter hair, tapered sides and back, allowing the top hair to grow longer. This elongated top is slicked back with the use of a styling gel, creating a distinctive contour that resembles the tail of a duck. It's a style that captures the essence of the rebellious 1950s, synonymous with Elvis and rock 'n' roll.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h3 id=6579bdefb3a85><strong>3. The Army Cut</strong></h3><p><img alt="Elvis presley hairstyles" title="Elvis presley hairstyles" width=334 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-10/1697607060_shutterstock_2101463845-1.jpg></p><p>Elvis's military cut is characterized by its neat and short appearance, which reflects discipline and uniformity. Achieving this style is straightforward—maintain short hair length all around. The simplicity of this low-maintenance look makes it ideal for a clean and disciplined appearance.</p><h3 id=6579bdefb3a89><strong>4. The Elvis Quiff</strong></h3><p><img alt="Elvis presley hairstyles" title="Elvis presley hairstyles" width=1000 height=527 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-10/1697606865_shutterstock_1856087899-1.jpg></p><p>The Elvis quiff, which emerged after his military service, demands a taller front with shorter sides. To create this signature style, blow-drying your hair with a blow dryer while lifting the front to generate volume. The next step involves a firm-hold pomade to craft the show into the desired quiff shape. The quiff's flamboyance showcased his transition back into entertainment and stardom.</p><h3 id=6579bdefb3a8d><strong>5. The Slicked-back Look</strong></h3><p><img alt="Elvis presley hairstyles" title="Elvis presley hairstyles" width=1000 height=667 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-10/1697606865_shutterstock_347435690-1-1.jpg></p><p>Elvis's polished and sophisticated slicked-back style, complemented by his striking hair color, epitomized his artistic maturation. Achieving this look entails maintaining relatively long hair on top. Apply a generous amount of hair dye or pomade to ensure the hair remains slicked back with precision, and high-quality hair gel can help maintain the look. Regularly comb the hair backward, creating a polished and mature finish with the assistance of the right hair product.</p><h3><strong>6. The Mutton Chops</strong></h3><p><img alt="Elvis presley hairstyles" title="Elvis presley hairstyles" width=1000 height=898 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-10/1697606866_shutterstock_637526245-1.jpg></p><p>Elvis, during his late 1960s comeback, sported distinctive mutton chops, a striking choice for curly brunette hair. These sideburns were characterized by their long and bushy nature, creating a unique contrast with the rest of the face being clean-shaven. To achieve and maintain this bold look, ensure your damp hair is styled appropriately, and every couple of weeks, trim and shape the sideburns as needed. This style is a standout choice for those with coily hair types and has become a part of Elvis’s iconic image.</p><h3><strong>7. The Long And Wavy</strong></h3><p><img alt="Elvis presley hairstyles" title="Elvis presley hairstyles" width=332 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-10/1697606866_shutterstock_135356897-1.jpg></p><p>In his later years, Elvis embraced longer and wavier hair, adding flamboyance to his on-stage presence. Achieving this look requires growing your hair long and naturally wavy. You can enhance the waves using a curling iron or styling products, creating a casual yet striking appearance reminiscent of his later-stage career.</p><h3><strong>8. The Jeweled Hair</strong></h3><p><img alt="Elvis presley hairstyles" title="Elvis presley hairstyles" width=1000 height=667 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-10/1697606866_shutterstock_1865937778-1.jpg></p><p>Elvis's jeweled hair look, particularly during his Las Vegas performances, is about adding decorative clips, jewels, or hairpins to your styled hair. To achieve this glamorous and eye-catching effect, ensure that these embellishments are securely fastened in your hair, adding an extra layer of extravagance.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h3><strong>9. The Bejeweled Jumpsuit Era</strong></h3><p><img alt="Elvis presley hairstyles" title="Elvis presley hairstyles" width=1000 height=473 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-10/1697606867_shutterstock_148382900-1.jpg></p><p>The 1970s marked the famous jumpsuit era for Elvis look.
