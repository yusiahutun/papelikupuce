But he’s let the world know that despite it not being a very accurate depiction, he “appreciates the effort.” <a href=#>Celebrity</a> wax figures are common in this day and age. Fans can easily go to a niche museum and pose next to their favorite stars. But sometimes, they don’t all go to plan in the sculpting process.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lil-wayne-had-a-few-choice-words-for-the-museum>Lil Wayne had a few choice words for the museum</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1421812935-1024x683.jpg><p>The figurine debuted at the Hollywood Wax Museum in Pigeon Forge yesterday, October 23. However, word traveled fast over the <a href=#>music</a> star’s new addition, and it wasn’t all positive. Wayne took to X, formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>, to share his grievances with his lookalike.</p><p>“Sorry wax museum but dat s**t ain’t me! You tried tho and I appreciate the effort,” he wrote.</p><p>In the wax work, the 41-year-old can be seen exposing his tattooed chest as he looks to be removing his dot-patterned shirt. He also wears blue and red tartan trousers and brown shoes with a fluffy white rim.</p><p>Two necklaces hang around his neck as he grins from ear to ear.</p><p>Fans reacted to the statue and didn’t seem to be as forgiving after the Lollipop hitmaker ripped into the museum’s interpretation.</p><p>Some even joked that his height was incredibly too small.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lil-wayne-isn-t-the-only-one-with-this-problem>Lil Wayne isn’t the only one with this problem</h2><p>Recently, another celebrity, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, was given a waxwork at the Grevin Museum in Paris, France. But <a href=#>it was also criticized</a> by fans and the WWE fight-turned-Hollywood-actor himself</p><p>It was mainly denounced for the fact that the life-size figure was much paler in comparison to the actual <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star.</p><p>Debuting it earlier this week, they wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a> [translated to English]: “First day for Dwayne Johnson in Grévin, already in the spotlight with our visitors. Are you going to visit him?”</p><p>The Rock called on those working at the tourist attraction to “update my wax figure with some important details, starting with my skin color.”</p><p>He later took to social media to say that he would “stop in and have a drink with myself” next time he was in the country.</p><p>“For the record, I’m going to have my team reach out to our friends at Grevin Museum. And next time I’m in Paris, I’ll stop in and have a drink with myself,” he penned.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fixing-the-problem>Fixing the problem</h2><p>Since then, the museum has shared that they are making the right <a href=# rel=nofollow>changes</a> to the 51-year-old’s statue, according to the BBC.</p><p>In a press release before it was unveiled, the museum said it had been “painstaking” work to complete the waxwork. It explained his eyes had been redone three times, as an example. They have now accepted his criticism and worked overnight to “remedy the skin tone” of it.</p><p>The director of the museum, Yves Delhommeau, initially said it was a “lighting issue” that caused him to be whitewashed. However, he then said he will make a visit to their museum “later on to see if there are other modifications that need to be made.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2eBcLjIpWSwmamjsrR51pqvZp6ZnMKzsYydoJ1lmJ66brDIq6uyZZGjsW6106xkqaqVqcG6ecKlnJqqXam8br%2FEnmShp6dk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./josina-anderson-net-worth-age-boyfriend-height-career.html><span>←</span><span>Josina Anderson- Net Worth, Age, Boyfriend, Height, Career</span></a>
