The card saw Bo walk across the White House lawn on a snowy day.</p><h2>2013</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Obama-Christmas-Card-2013.jpg><p>The 2013 Christmas card included a popup of the White House, with the Obama family’s two black dogs, Bo and Sunny, walking on the law. “As we gather around this season, may the warmth and joy of the holidays fill your home,” the family signed.</p><h2>2014</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Obama-Christmas-Card-2014.jpg><p>In 2014, the Obamas used an illustrated Christmas card with drawings of their dogs, Bo and Sunny, in the White House. “In this wondrous season, may the spirit of the holidays bring you strength and happiness,” the family signed.</p><h2>2015</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Obama-christmas-card-2015.jpg><p>For 2015, the Obamas shared a Christmas card that paid tribute to the Washington Monument and the Jefferson and Lincoln memorials. “With gratitude and cheer, we send our warmest wishes for health and happiness this holiday season,” they signed the card.</p><h2>2016</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Obama-Christmas-Card-2016-1.jpg><p>Their last year in the White House, the Obamas used a photo taken by White House photographer Pete Souza from a formal State Dinner with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> post at the time, Souza explained that the picture was a last-minute shot that Trudeau asked for of just the Obama family. Then, he said I should do a photo of just the Obama’s. I could have said, ‘sir we already did one before you arrived.’ But instead, I clicked off a few quick frames. And lo and behold, it was this picture that Justin Trudeau asked me to take which everyone loved as the choice for the 2016 White House holiday card,” he wrote.</p><h2>2017</h2><p>The first year out of the White House, the Obamas didn’t share one of their traditional Christmas cards. Instead, Barack tweeted a photo of him and his family with some kids dressed as elves. “On behalf of the Obama family, Merry Christmas! We wish you joy and peace this holiday season,” he wrote.</p><h2>2018</h2><p>The Obama family didn’t post a formal Christmas card for 2018, but Barack did share a sweet photo of him kissing Michelle on the cheek with some holly above them. “Enjoy the holiday season with the ones you love. Michelle and I wish you a very Merry Christmas!” he captioned the picture.</p><h2>2019</h2><p>For 2019, Michelle shared a photo of the Obama family Christmas card signed by the four Obama family members and their two dogs, Bo and Sunny. “We wish you a holiday season that sparkles with magic and wonder and a new year that’s filled with peace and hope,” the card read, along with a red flower and a sketch of the tree. The Obamas signed the card with “All our best.”</p><h2>2020</h2><p>For 2020, Barack tweeted about how “different” Christmas would be that year with many families celebrating virtually instead of in person. “This Christmas looks different for all of us. As we spend time with those we love—in person or virtually—let us celebrate the blessings we cherish, embrace the spirit of giving, and look out for one another. From my family to yours, Merry Christmas!” he tweeted, along with a photo of the Obama family’s 2020 Christmas card, which read: “Wishing you and yours a joyous and peaceful holiday season.” The card was signed by Barack, Michelle, Malia, Sasha, Bo and Sunny.</p><h2>2021</h2><p>Instead of a 2021 Christmas card, Barack shared a photo of the Obama family dog, Sunny. “Verified Merry Christmas, everybody! This year, I got a little help spreading holiday cheer from Sunny. Wishing you all a peaceful and joyful holiday season with the ones you love,” he captioned an Instagram photo of Sunny in a Santa hat in front of a Christmas tree. The post came seven months after the Obama’s other family dog, Bo, died on May 8, 2021, from cancer at the age of 12. “Today our family lost a true friend and loyal companion,” Barack tweeted at the time. “For more than a decade, Bo was a constant, gentle presence in our lives — happy to see us on our good days, our bad days, and every day in between.”</p><h2>2022</h2><p>The Obama family also forewent a Christmas card in 2022 and shared family photos on their Instagram accounts instead. Barack shared an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram photo</a> of him, Michelle, Malia and Sasha at a White House event. “Merry Christmas, everybody! One of the best parts of the holiday season is getting to spend time with the special people in our lives. I hope you all have a wonderful and joyful Christmas,” he captioned the post. Michelle, for her part, shared an Instagram photo of Barack kissing her cheek under a mistletoe in the White House. “Verified From our family to yours, wishing you all a wonderful Christmas filled with happiness, light, and joy! 🎄 As we get ready to wrap up this year and look to the next, let’s remember to reflect on our blessings and channel them into giving back and being kind to those around us,” she wrote in the caption.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/A-Promised-Land.jpg><p>For more about the Obamas, read Barack Obama’s 2020 memoir, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">A Promised Land</a>.
