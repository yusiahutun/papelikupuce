They want the man to put in the work when making a move. It is not only charming but also makes the girl feel some type of way. You may notice that many men admire you from a distance but do not make a move. Why do guys stare but never approach me? This question can be disturbing as no one wants to feel unapproachable. Feeling wanted and having a guy make a move is one of the best things about being a girl.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6e383efe07820660.png><p class=align-left>There are several stages of approaching girls. The first is the glance, followed by a long stare, a smile, and probably some waving, and finally getting the guts to move and initiate a conversation. Not many men can pull this off smoothly. Some of the moves backfire, which gets to be embarrassing for the man and sometimes awkward for a girl.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7286fe16d2ed7836.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ trick questions to ask your friends (with answers)</span></p></a><h2>Top reasons guys stare but never approach me</h2><p class=align-left>Girls can attest that every man uses a unique tactic when trying to initiate a conversation. What happens if a man only stares and never bothers to ask for your number? The following are some of the reasons as to why guys stare but not approach you:</p><h3>1. You look intimidating</h3><p class=align-left>This may seem like a cliché, but having an intimidating look sends guys away. Your cool, fashionista and handsome neighbour may be eyeing you for days, but that intimidating look you put on turns him off. There is nothing wrong with looking bossy. Everyone loves a girl that is in charge.</p><p class=align-left>What frightens most, however, is having a girl whose presence not only threatens them but also makes them fidget when they are talking. Having a wholesome conversation involves making direct eye contact and reciprocating the energy given in discussions. A man who thinks that talking to you will make him appear smaller will never have the guts to approach you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/53d302b45e0254d6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 16 funny numbers to call when you are bored or for pranks</span></p></a><h3>2. You are not easy to crack</h3><p class=align-left>In the age of social media, many people try to remain private even as they share some aspects of their lives. In the real world, you can almost tell the next person’s character and their next move based on how you relate. Not being an open book can be disadvantageous in certain circumstances.</p><p class=align-left>Hiding fun things about yourself and brushing conversations off when others try to get to know you is not the best move you can pull if you are mingling with others. Your friend or the people you hang out with may ask questions or suggest things that may make you open up a little just to get to know you. Not participating in such matters may discourage some guys from asking you out. He will make eye contact but never talk.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Girlfriend duties in a relationship: 15 things you are supposed to do</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs2erjrflimk4g.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best dating sites for black women</span></p></a><h3>3. You are too serious at the gym</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7286fe16d2ed7836.jpg><p class=align-left>A gym is a happy place for many. You get to lose a few pounds, gain weight in the right places, release negative energy, and take in all the positive vibes just from exercising and the music. The gym is also a popular meeting joint for lovers who get to be life partners. Why do guys stare at me at the gym? You are less social and more serious at the gym.</p><p class=align-left>The exercises can be heavy, but there is nothing wrong with saying hi to your neighbour as you walk in or walk out of the facility. Long-term friendships are made at the gym. That guy who is admiring you at the gym will approach you faster if he sees a less serious and sometimes goofy face as you go about your business at the gym.</p><h3>4. The fear of success</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ac1d6a28101354e4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>150+ headlines for a dating site for females to attract guys online</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A guy may have a crush on you for weeks or even months but never reveal it to you. Why is this? Some men have a fear of success. They will come to talk to you, and even ask you out, and instead of rejecting their advances, you will agree to them. This can be overwhelming for some men.</p><p class=align-left>He has bagged the prettiest girl in the neighbourhood, what next? Will he be able to impress you every day? Will you get bored with him? Does he still think that he is good enough for you even after you accept him? All these questions mixed with feelings of excitement and confusion, can make a guy just stare, and never approach you.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>How to pull away emotionally from a guy you love</p><h3>5. You are the embarrassing drunk friend</h3><p class=align-left>Drinking is fun. Overdrinking is not. Many people enjoy getting wasted as it helps them cope with life and release the stress they probably have been carrying throughout the day. Friends that drink and become disorderly are the least favourite in the group. Do not be that friend.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a329d0f18dc6ec02.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 behavioural signs of Taurus man when he likes you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Why does he avoid me but still stare? Your cute colleague may be having feelings for you during the day but despise you once you have one too many. Do not be that friend that walks over tables, pees anyhow call people names, and engages in all manner of things when drunk. Other than embarrassing your friends, you may be sending away potential suitors in the name of having fun.</p><h3>6. Everyone knows your business</h3><p class=align-left>You are known for airing dirty laundry in the open when you fall out with someone, and you never hide the miserable things in your life, you cannot keep a secret, you talk about your life with anyone that bothers to listen, you are always rowdy and known by everyone in the neighbourhood. These characters are not the best to have if you want to have a good relationship with people.</p><p class=align-left>No guy wants to be with a girl that is known in the whole neighbourhood, and especially for negative things. He will look at your direction, wave, or even hold a small talk, but that will be all. He knows that if he makes a move and pours his heart to you, you will never shut up about it. A little mystery goes a long way.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8b6a9c4ebf2550e6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What boys want: 15 things guys like in girls but won't ask for</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Relationships you will encounter in your love life</p><h3>7. You are a snob or wear that snobby look 24/7</h3><p class=align-left>Snobs are phoney. Everyone hates snobs. Many snobs thrive on entitlement and putting others down. A snob thinks that the world revolves around them. They will always boast about what is happening with them and all that they have accomplished. You sure do not want to be referred to as a snobby anyone.</p><p class=align-left>It is not a good thing to be. Being a snob or appearing snobby will send away anyone who ever had thoughts of approaching you or even being a friend. Try and be friendly with your neighbours, colleagues, and even stranger. You never really know who you are talking with.</p><h3>8. You don’t act single</h3><p class=align-left>Wondering why he always stares at me but never talks to me? You come in with a new guy at every event. Your friends cannot tell who you are dating, who you are having a casual fling with or the guy you are just friends with. There is nothing wrong with having many friends. It only means that you are popular and even increases your chances of getting more opportunities.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f39ac4e902a235e4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>My girlfriend has a celebrity crush: Should I be worried?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Appearing like you have a boyfriend every time you go for a social gathering, however, will make many men back off. You will notice the stares, the smiles, and admiration, but not a single guy will approach you for anything.</p><h3>9. That ring</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/53d302b45e0254d6.jpg><p class=align-left>Rings are lovely accessories. Every girl has that favourite ring they put on when going for parties and other social events as it blends well with their outfit of the day. The funny thing is that not many guys understand how rings are worn and what they mean. You probably like wearing your ring on the ring finger. Nothing wrong with that. You look gorgeous as you are pretty even without it.</p><p class=align-left>Why does he keep looking at me from a distance? A guy that had planned on approaching you will take a step back once they spot the ring. They will think that you are either engaged or married, and there goes your prospect. It would not hurt to mind how you wear your ring, especially when you are searching for a partner. If nevertheless when single and not looking, wear your ring away and flaunt it for the world without a care.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3c6d0788aff601ae.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ best funny jokes to tell a girl you like: impress her</span></p></a><h3>10. You are cute but mean</h3><p class=align-left>A girl that is rude to waiters, bank tellers, janitors, or anyone they deem of a lower class than them is the most unattractive thing ever. You may be the best-looking in your squad, but habits like talking rubbish to those that serve you or those that are lower than you may throw not only a crush off but also the people that you associate with.</p><p class=align-left>It costs nothing to be kind. Say hi to the cleaning lady every time you get to the office, ask the receptionist how their day has been, say thank you and leave a tip to the waiter. It is the little things that count. You are pretty but guys don’t approach you. Do not carry an ugly personality beneath your pretty face. No one likes that.</p><h3>11. You are not social even in social gatherings</h3><p class=align-left>Interact with friends and strangers, ask for their numbers, share drinks with them and party like there is no tomorrow when going out with friends. Finding a spot at the club and staring at your phone the whole time you out beat the logic of going out in the first place.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7222f56bbfd3a256.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing badass quotes for men</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A guy you have feelings for but afraid to make the first move for will not talk to you if he sees that you are alone and quiet in your little corner. Be a social butterfly when out. It is more fun that way.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>How to kiss a girl romantically</p><h3>12. It’s not you, it’s them</h3><p class=align-left>It’s not you. It’s me. This is a phrase mostly used by people who are in a relationship. The same words can, however, be used when guys are not able to approach you confidently. What does it mean when you catch a guy staring at you? He likes you. Some guys are just nervous or do not know what to say.</p><p class=align-left>They will see you, even wave but will not have the confidence to hold a full conversation. Do not feel bad for being too attractive that a guy cannot approach you; it’s not you; it’s him. If you are confident enough, you can approach him and see how it goes. What’s the worst that could happen? A polite decline? Well, at least you were bold enough to be the one to initiate the first move.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to pull away emotionally from a guy you love</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The approaching process and getting to know a person can be overwhelming. Some people like face to face meetings while others prefer that their first interactions happen online. Whichever the case, do not stress too much when you see men staring but not approaching you. Do not lose sleep asking why do guys stare but never approach me? Everyone has their reasons. It does not make you less beautiful. Good things take time. It’s okay if your crush keeps on looking towards your direction but never says a word. He is probably thinking of the best way to impress you.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>How to kiss better: Top tips and techniques</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FlW5nb2ldrLW6ecausKxlo6mus7GMmqepqp%2BWsKl6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./assassins-creed-odyssey.html><span>←</span><span>The Eyes of Kosmos, Assassin's Creed Odyssey Quest</span></a>
