Courtney Sullivan</a></h3><p>Are diamonds really forever? In J. Courtney Sullivan’s The Engagements, she tackles this exact question as she tells the captivating story of four couples and one ring spanning more than a century. As the ring moves throughout history, it not only remains a symbol of love (whether it be good or bad), it becomes a symbol of the shifts in society and culture over the course of the 20th century. As the stories progress and intertwine with one another, we get a fascinating look at the history of the institution of marriage and all that it stands for.</p><p><strong>Where to buy: <a rel=nofollow href=#>from $13.68, Amazon</a></strong></p><h3>2. <a href=#>The Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/the-ocean-at-the-end-of-the-lane-neil-gaiman-reese-witherspoon-book-club-closer-weekly.jpg><p>In The Ocean at the End of the Lane, our narrator is a middle-aged man who finds himself in his hometown after attending a funeral.

He soon finds himself sitting beside the pond on the property recounting a strange story to the older woman who now lives there. As he tells his story, he soon comes to realize that this is not just a forgotten tale but instead, unremembered events that came rushing back, leading him to question everything he knows about his strange little town, Lettie Hempstock, and himself.</p><p><strong>Where to buy: <a rel=nofollow href=#>from $6.48, Amazon</a></strong></p><h3>3. <a href=#>Me Before You by JoJo Moyes</a></h3><p>After losing her job, Louisa “Lou” Clark leaves everything she knows behind to take a job caretaking for former businessman and extreme-sports enthusiast Will Traynor following an accident that left him partially paralyzed. Bitter and a bit cold at first, it takes Will time to warm up to the bright and effervescent Lou. But as a romance begins to blossom, it all but falls apart when Lou learns of Will’s dark secret. Tender and heartbreaking at moments, Me Before You is a story of love and the hard sacrifices we’re sometimes forced to make for the ones we love.</p><p><strong>Where to buy: <a rel=nofollow href=#>from $8.09, Amazon</a></strong></p><h3>4. <a href=#>The Art Forger by B.A. Shapiro</a></h3><p>Centered around the true story of the infamous art heist at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum — still the largest unsolved art theft in history — painter Claire Roth receives a delivery on her doorstep that will soon send her on the journey of a lifetime.

A winding, whirlwind of a mystery, follow Claire as she attempts to uncover the truth behind an age old adage: Everything is not what it seems.</p><p><strong>Where to buy: <a rel=nofollow href=#>from $10.95, Amazon</a></strong></p><h3>5. <a href=#>Let’s Explore Diabetes With Owls by David Sedaris</a></h3><p>In Let’s Explore Diabetes With Owls by one of America’s most popular humorists, David Sedaris simply does what he does best: delights. A collection filled with the ostensibly autobiographical, self-deprecating humor we’ve come to expect from Sedaris, Owls leads us through each essay, peppered with hilarious anecdotes from his life that, as funny as they are, always end with an emotional gut punch of raw love and emotion. Great for those who enjoy expertly written prose with a penetrating current of humor, it’s merely another example of why David Sedaris is one of the best of the best.</p><p><strong>Where to buy: <a rel=nofollow href=#>from $9.33, Amazon</a></strong></p><h3>6. <a href=#>Look at Me by Jennifer Egan</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/look-at-me-jennifer-egan-reese-witherspook-book-club-closer-weekly.jpg><p>What would you do if the thing that made you you was taken away from you? In Look At Me, Jennifer Egan attempts to answer this question with Charlotte Swenson, a fashion model who, following a horrific car crash that leaves her face so badly shattered it required eighty titanium screws to reassemble, attempts to return to the glory of her life as a model with one thing missing — her famous face. A dissection of our cultural obsession with image, beauty, and identity, this book follows Swenson and other casualties of societal chastisement whose lives inexplicably converge in one thrilling and mesmerizing tale.</p><p><strong>Where to buy: <a rel=nofollow href=#>$13.56, Amazon</a></strong></p><h3>7. <a href=#>Dad Is Fat by Jim Gaffigan</a></h3><p>If there’s one thing stand-up comedian Jim Gaffigan is known for, it’s his dad jokes (and we’re not talking about puns here, people). Gaffigan is famous for his specials where he goes into hour-long spiels about being a father to five children and all that encompasses, so it only makes sense that a book on the funny side of parenting would follow. Documenting his wins and losses in fatherhood, this book is as hilarious as it is relatable to those who come home to a rambunctious pack of children every night. Dad is Fat may be, at its most surface level, about a dad who is fat, but damn if he isn’t doing his best.</p><p><strong>Where to buy: <a rel=nofollow href=#>$13.65, Amazon</a></strong></p><h3>8. <a href=#>The Glitter Plan: How We Started Juicy Couture for $200 and Turned It into a Global Brand by Pamela Skaist-Levy, Gela Nash-Taylo, and Booth Moore</a></h3><p>What happens when you take two friends who bond over their shared inability to find the “perfect” t-shirt and add $200 and a whole bunch of tenacity and creativity?

All it takes it a little sparkle.</p><p><strong>Where to buy: <a rel=nofollow href=#>$12.23, Amazon</a></strong></p><h3>9. <a href=#>Big Little Lies by Liane Moriarty</a></h3><p>It’s the <a href=#>star-studded show</a> that became a runaway hit in 2017, winning every major accolade and acclaim across the board. But before Big Little Lies made it to HBO, it was a gripping, bestselling book by Liane Moriarty. The book follows three mothers — Madeline, Celeste, and Jane — and their not-so-simple lives in the fictional beachside town of Pirriwee, Australia.

Continuing his work as an expert observer of human behavior, the stories in this book manages to take the ordinary, everyday parts of life we often take for granted and chops and screws them into laugh-out-loud funny situations, all the while making keen observations about the people we surround ourselves with, and ultimately, the people we are.</p><p><strong>Where to buy: <a rel=nofollow href=#>from $11.83, Amazon</a></strong></p><h3>11. <a href=#>Not That Kind Of Girl by Lena Dunham</a></h3><p>In Not That Kind of Girl, actress, director, and now author Lena Dunham shares her tales of lessons learned in love, life, and growing up as a woman in today’s world.

Yet, in 2010 the United States Army created Cultural Support Teams (CST), with an all-women roster that cultivated personal connections amidst a terrifying war zone. These teams had a special purpose of interrogating the women found during the raids of enemies’ compounds and frisking them for dangerous weapons. Rather than the horror of American soldiers barking orders and doing patdowns, the women created a calmer environment in what typically is nothing short of chaos, panic, and trauma for both sides. Relationships were formed between women from vastly different countries and the women within the group. Gayle Tzemach Lemmon follows the journey of a CST-2 team led by Ashley White, a strong, admirable soldier, on what is a groundbreaking innovation in a male-dominated organization that used to only fuel feelings of hatred.</p><p><strong>Where to buy: <a rel=nofollow href=#>$8.98, Amazon</a></strong></p><h3>18. <a href=#>Luckiest Girl Alive by Jessica Knoll</a></h3><p>Keeping secrets never ends well and unfortunately Ani FaNelli has a few.

The book takes you on an emotional roller coaster and allows you to witness how a family bond can push you to the brink of losing yourself. This story will even leave you questioning who you know and who you think you know.</p><p><strong>Where to buy: <a rel=nofollow href=#>$8.79, Amazon</a></strong></p><h3>20. <a href=#>#GIRLBOSS by Sophia Amoruso</a></h3><p>The incredibly witty and smart female entrepreneur behind the $100 million-dollar fashion retailer Nasty Gal, Sophia Amoruso, didn’t have an easy start to where she is now.

She touches on self-consciousness, motherhood, marriage, and aging all in a way that any woman can relate to. You’ll take a walk down memory lane through her photo shoots throughout the years, starting in the mid-1980s, and annotated by no one other than Cindy herself. The book also includes never-before-seen, unpublished photos that give a more intimate look at the life of one of the most famous fashion queens.</p><p><strong>Where to buy: <a rel=nofollow href=#>$27.99, Amazon</a></strong></p><h3>22. <a href=#>In a Dark, Dark Wood by Ruth Ware</a></h3><p>The title itself is enough to give you chills.

In an Amazon review, Mary R Wilke wrote, “I am not a person that rates books but after reading this book, felt I should let others know how excellent this book is. Kimberly Williams-Paisley wrote a touching and informative book on her family’s journey with her mother’s dementia. There were so many moments in the book that I could relate to as I experience my own journey with my mom.

The novel begins when Federal Agent Aaron Falk comes back to his hometown for the first time in years for his old friend Luke’s funeral. And in such a small town, there are plenty of secrets. Amazon reviewer David said, “Overnight I finished Jane Harper’s novel — a story I found difficult to put down until I reached the last page. For a first novel it is outstanding. The author writes in beautiful, descriptive language and, at the same time, keeps socking the reader between the eyes with the revelations that unfold in this terrible story of a brutal family murder in an outback country town — a town that seeps with anger, bitterness, violence, oppressive heat and blow-flies.”</p><p><strong>Where to buy: <a rel=nofollow href=#>from $10.99, Amazon</a></strong></p><h3>42. <a href=#>The Alice Network by Kate Quinn</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rw-bookclub-2000.jpg><p>(Photo Credit: Instagram)</p><p>The Alice Network is a story of two amazing women, across two different timelines.
