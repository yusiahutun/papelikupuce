Names and photos of the stars were shown on the screen to Charlie Puth’s tear-jerking music, See You Again. Although, Friends legend <a href=#>Matthew Perry</a> was also given a special tribute, with the theme song of the <a href=#>TV</a> show being played during his part. But despite big celebrities like <a href=#>Angus Cloud</a> and Richard Belzer being a part of the tribute, fans weren’t happy others were left out or ‘forgotten’.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-emmys-in-memoriam-forgets-stars-in-tribute>Emmys in Memoriam ‘forgets’ stars in tribute</h2><p>Charlie Puth got up on stage to sing his emotional hit at a piano. He then transitioned into the <a href=#>Friends</a> theme song ‘I’ll Be There For You’ to commemorate Matthew Perry.</p><p><a href=#>Paul Reuben</a>, Kristie Alley and Andre Braugher were also mentioned in the list.</p><p>Although there are a number of deaths in the movie and TV business each year, sending shockwaves around the world, not all were mentioned in the Emmys in Memoriam segment.</p><p>Viewers pointed out Ray Stevenson, Piper Laurie, Ryan O’Neal and Jerry Springer were among the list ‘forgotten’. Others named Joyce Randolph, Kevin Turen, Richard Moll, David Soul and Bob McGrath as TV stars who were ‘snubbed’. Each of these <a href=#>celebrities</a> had sadly died in late 2022 or last year.</p><p>The original <a href=#>Emmy Awards</a> were set to take place in September last year. However, due to the actors and writers strike, it was delayed. This meant the annual event was pushed back to January, four months later. But it means the normal fall schedule will continue for 2024, so fans can expect two Emmys this year alone.</p><p>If viewers thought the timing of the delay affected who was featured in the list, <a href=#>Andre Braugher</a>, from Brooklyn 999, was still named. He sadly passed away suddenly at the end of last year, on December 11. This would have been after the original Emmy date of September.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-were-still-upset-by-the-stars-who-were-left-out>Fans were still upset by the stars who were left out</h2><p>The Emmys in Memoriam was upsetting, to say the least. Fans admitted they were ‘crying’ when big stars appeared on the screen, like Perry and Braugher.</p><p>One said: “Charlie Puth singing the friend’s theme song for the ‘in memoriam’ at the #emmys ?! Are you trying to make me sob?”</p><p>Then a second echoed: “Charlie Puth singing “I’ll Be There For You” in honor of Matthew Perry at the Emmys is a BIG tearjerker moment.”</p><p>A third said: “There are always a few people left out because these shows only have so much time allotted for each segment. They’ll be their excuse anyway.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>No Ray Stevenson in the 'in memoriam'</p><p>Thats a shame :/</p>— darragh (@darragh_sc) <a href=#>January 16, 2024</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aDcLHMprCsZZaWu7R50pqbnZ2emrFurthmmp6klZe%2FqsDInqpmq56qr6Oxw2agp2Wknba0ediemKurXaKyrrvRopimZaSntqPB055m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./coastline-ii.html><span>←</span><span>Coastline II Laurel Mercantile</span></a>
