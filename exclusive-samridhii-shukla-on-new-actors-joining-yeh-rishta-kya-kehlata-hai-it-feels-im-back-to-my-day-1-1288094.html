Although I wasn't really very close to them, I have spent five months shooting with these prominent actors in the show. We had many scenes that were liked by the audiences, and now starting over from scratch with new actors seems a little challenging."</p><p>She added, "Honestly, I feel like I'm on Day 1 on the sets of Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai. Although I'm excited and looking forward to how things would turn out. I just hope that the viewers accept the changes and we are able to add to the legacy of the show created by the makers over fifteen years.
