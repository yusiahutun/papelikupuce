And then came Faith Hill. Her style icon was Audrey Hepburn, and her red carpet looks echoed the timeless, clean-lined minimalism of the Hollywood legend (with a subtle southern twist, of course).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Through her love of craftsmanship and designers like Versace, Armani, and Tom Ford, Hill paved the way for a style renaissance in country music that has continued with fashion-lovers like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taylor Swift</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Carrie Underwood</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Kelsea Ballerini</a>. "There was a time in country music when it was all big hair and as many rhinestones as you could put on your body, and I think Faith brought it back to being natural and classic," says Ballerini, who has opened for Hill and her husband, Tim McGraw. "She has a girl-next-door approach to style, but it's so elevated and sleek — and that's why I'm obsessed with every look that she's worn."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since Ballerini, who recently dropped her third album, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1><i>Kelsea</i></a>, has long admired Hill's music and fashion vibes, we connected the two singers to talk shop for <i>InStyle</i>'s June Style Crush chat. On the agenda? Red carpet regrets, a mutual love for white T-shirts and worn-in jeans, and why Ballerini is now invited to borrow from Hill's closet (lucky girl!).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Their full chat, below.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>KELSEA BALLERINI</b>: Faith, I'm so happy to talk to you. What a time. How are you and the family doing?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>FAITH HILL</b>: Everyone's well. We're social distancing in the Bahamas trying to stay healthy and not go insane. How are you?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>KB</b>: I'm just excited to have some human interaction! I'm stuck in downtown Nashville, overlooking a very empty interstate. And I'm trying to learn how to cook. So far, it's decent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>FH</b>: Oh, I'll send some easy recipes to get you started. We've been playing cards and board games. I'm a news junkie, so anything to keep me from watching TV all the time is good. [laughs]</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>KB</b>: I was thinking about when I first got to know you. I opened for you and Tim in London, and we ran into each other backstage. I was nervous and you were so friendly to me.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>FH</b>: We took <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>a picture together</a>, and I loved it because you were wearing a merch shirt. And then I also remember when we <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>performed together at the CMAs</a> [below]. That show has always terrified me more than the Grammys or the Oscars, and you had such poise and confidence. You actually made me feel calmer that night.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>KB</b>: Oh my gosh, thank you. I can assure you that I didn't feel calm, but I'm so glad it came off that way! So, since we're talking style today, I have to tell you that I'm obsessed with every look you've worn. There was a time in country music when it was all big hair and as many rhinestones as you could put on your body, and I think you brought it back to being natural and classic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>FH</b>: Bless your heart. But it took me a minute. And it took a great stylist, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Petra Flannery</a>, whom I've worked with for most of my career. Sometimes I would put on an outfit to perform and I'd feel nothing like myself. What's the point of that? I had to learn to be comfortable in my own skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>KB</b>: In the beginning, did people try to tell you what to wear?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>FH</b>: No one directed me. I just made the wrong choices. [laughs] I used to find pieces at vintage shops and go to Michaels to find some really unattractive flowers to pin on a vest. There was a lot of crazy stuff that I thought was cool.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>KB</b>: It happens to the best of us. I wrote my first album when I was 19, and all the clothes I wore were bright and glittery. I also look back and cringe a little bit. [laughs] How would you say your style has evolved over the years?</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>FH</b>: Well, my look definitely changed with each album. I also just became more interested in style while working with Petra. Sometimes she would bring clothes to me that would look so boring on the hanger, and I'd say, "No, I want a look that has a little more something-something." And she'd always say, "Faith, trust me. It'll look so much better on your body. It just doesn't have hanger appeal." And she was always right.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>KB: </strong>What's your strategy like for touring? I love to wear heels on stage, but when I'm headlining a show, the heels get chunkier and shorter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>FH: </strong>I remember for our Soul2Soul tour in 2006 and 2007, I had this incredible wardrobe planned with these amazing heels. And then once I got to rehearse, I had to change the entire wardrobe because I couldn't even walk in the shoes. We changed everything to slacks — my favorite thing to wear — and found some cool tennis shoes. I felt like a teenager! It was awesome.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>KB</b>: One of my favorite looks of yours was when we opened the CMAs. It was that black Armani Privé gown with a big architectural shoulder.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>FH</b>: Loved that. I also loved my <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>J. Mendel</a> gown at the2015 Oscars[above] and the white Chado Ralph Rucci look I wore to the 2011 CMAs. I try to find something with a sleeve because it gets so cold when you're nervous and waiting to perform at an awards show. What has been your favorite?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>KB</b>: My bright pink Zac Posen dress [below]. Zac hand-pinned it on my body, and I got to watch him go into artist mode. So cool. And he got me to wear a bright color, which is hard to do.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>FH</b>: That was gorgeous on you. I think your style is sassy, classy. You're just a sassy girl with a lot of class.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>KB</b>: That made my day. I'm walking into my closet right now thinking about what I actually wear, and my <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>x karla cropped white tees</a> have become the things I buy the most of. What is it for you?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>FH</b>: Probably white boyfriend T-shirts by ATM and black cashmere <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Michael Kors</a> turtlenecks. My go-to look for, like, the grocery store is probably a T-shirt, sneakers, and my favorite pair of Joie jeans that I've had for almost 20 years. It's almost like wearing sweats because they're so loose and comfy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>KB:</strong> I always used to wear tight jeans, but I just discovered this high-waisted boyfriend style by Agolde that I love. Jeans are the perfect article of clothing. I really stand by that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>FH:</strong> Oh, I agree. 100%.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>KB</b>: You and Tim always look so sharp together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>FH</b>: That's sweet. Tim's wardrobe is insane. I mean, his closet is so much more interesting than mine.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>KB</b>: I don't ask my husband, Morgan [Evans], for fashion advice. He's from Australia, so he thinks that board shorts are pants.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>FH</b>: Ha! I do ask Tim for his opinion, but we also have three daughters who give their thoughts very freely. Just in case I ever wanted to walk out the door in something that I shouldn't, they let me know. [laughs]</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>KB</b>: I bet! Whose style do you admire?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>FH</b>: Audrey Hepburn's, in terms of dresses. But I like a woman that can wear a pantsuit too. I love Tom Ford's style too. Tom is such a craftsman. He knows how to dress a man, and he knows how to dress a woman. Strong and sexy but in a way that's not offensive.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_74-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>KB</b>: What's your most prized fashion possession?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>FH</b>: The white shirt I wore for my first showcase at Warner Bros. I got it at The Limited Too. Remember that store? And I had a seamstress sew lace across the front. My gosh. But I got a record deal, so I always kept it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>KB</b>: OK, one last thing. Your music video in the desert for <i><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Breathe</a> </i>set the bar for all of us. So many artists like Carrie [Underwood] and me have tipped our hats to it in our own videos. Did you know it would be so iconic?</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_80-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>FH</b>: Honestly, what I worried about most was my mom seeing it. And I was an adult woman with two children at the time! I told her, "I want you to know that I had clothes on when I was under that sheet in bed." [laughs]</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>KB</b>: A mom disclaimer! Well, you're everything that a new artist like me wants to be.
