Melinda’s father is Norwegian and they moved to Norway in 1998 when she was 12-years-old so Melinda could join the Norwegian National Ballet.</p><p>Dance was her original calling and Melinda went on to major in Performing Arts while at high school. But that passion to be on stage performing led Melinda down the modelling and acting route, rather than dance.</p><p>Melinda has a bachelor’s degree in development theory, which she obtained while also working as a model and waitress in Norway.</p><p>Her move to the states came after she competed in the Miss Universe pageant.</p><p>She has also pursued a variety of careers, including directing and producing. In 2013 she returned to Botswana with Norwegian musicians Nico & Vinz, to shoot a music video for their single, ‘Am I Wrong.’ Melinda’s music video has been viewed over 400 million times!</p><ul><li><span style=text-decoration:underline><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">OFFICE DRAMA QUEEN</a>:</strong></span> Get to know Kafia from Styling Hollywood – Instagram, job and more</li></ul><h3>Melinda’s pageant queen days</h3><p>Melinda touches upon her pageant days in the first episode of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>Styling Hollywood</span></a>, explaining that in 2010 she had won Miss Norway.</p><p>She participated in the pageant after her modelling career began to take off and her success in Norway allowed her to compete at the Miss Universe pageant in Las Vegas the same year.</p><p>Although she did not take the crown for Miss Universe – Ximena Navarrete of Mexico did – her performance boosted her modelling career once again and Melinda soon landed campaigns with Colgate, L’Oreal, Levi’s and more.</p><p>Melinda moved to New York in 2012, where she met Jason and Adair while working as a model. She then moved to Los Angeles two years later to further her acting and modelling career. Instead, things took a turn and Melinda ended up having a son in 2016. She started working at JSN soon after she had her son.</p><ul><li><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline><strong>WE WANT MORE:</strong></span></a> Will there be a season 2 of Netflix’s Blown Away?
