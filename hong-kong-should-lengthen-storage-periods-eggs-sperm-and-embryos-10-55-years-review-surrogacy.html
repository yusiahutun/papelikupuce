Some clinics charge as much as HK$200,000 for the service, covering the full period.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eunice Yung Hoi-yan, the party’s vice-chairwoman, argued the storage period should be lengthened given that women increasingly decided to marry later in life and there was no guarantee they could use the stored eggs during their prime pregnancy years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The party also said the government should consider allowing local eligible organisations to provide surrogacy services to couples in need.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong’s Human Reproductive Technology Ordinance prohibits couples from using donated eggs or those of surrogates.

In 2021, one-fifth of the population was elderly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">City leader Lee will hold two public consultations on the coming policy address on August 20 and 27, ahead of his speech on October 25.
