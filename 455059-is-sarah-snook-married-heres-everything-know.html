And there is a reason why people were not aware of the actress's marriage. She did a private ceremony in her backyard.</p><p class=align-left>So, who is Sarah Snook's husband? The actress married the love of her life, Dave Lawson. According to her interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Vogue Australia</a>, they married during the pandemic period.</p>At the beginning of the pandemic last year, I got locked down in Melbourne with one of my best mates, and we fell in love. We've been friends since 2014, lived together, travelled together, and are always excited to see each other, but platonic. We've just never been single at the same time. So, I proposed, and we got married in February in my backyard. It's been a ride. There's so much heartache and sadness in the world, but I've been fortunate on a micro personal level. There's charming grace in that, without the pandemic, we might not have ended up together so quickly.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1a977798eeaa6e5b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rebecca King-Crews: Family, nationality, ethnicity, cancer, siblings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>What about Sarah Snook's wedding pictures?

Although the story has popped up in many tabloids, the actress has not announced any baby news. She is just a victim of pregnancy surveillance that often happens to female actors in the entertainment industry. Grazia from Beth Ashley shared the comments about pregnancy surveillance on the platform's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter account</a>.</p>If Sarah Snook is pregnant, there's a reason she hasn't revealed this to the public. And if she's not, it could be challenging for her to hear false rumours about pregnancies, whether she's all for motherhood, actively avoiding it, or simply indifferent (because that's possible, too!)<h2>Quick facts about Sarah Snook</h2><li>Is Sarah Snook single?<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Sarah Snook married</a> during the pandemic to her best mate, Australian comedian Dave Lawson.</li><li>Is Sarah Snook Australian?
