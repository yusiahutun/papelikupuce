He was born on Nov. 27, 2007.</p><p>Cinco is the fifth in his family to be named Usher, but he doesn’t particularly want to be called that. “I have one son, Cinco, who does not like to be called Usher, who tries to get away from it,” Usher told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Tamron Hall</a>.</p><p>“You know, I named my son Usher so every time he’s out, obviously, there’s that pressure,” he told Shannon Sharpe on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Club Shay Shay</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>When he was five years old, Cinco was involved in an accident in Usher’s pool as he was trying to obtain a toy in a drain. “I am blessed and fortunate to say that my son Usher V is doing well and is recovering,” Usher said in a statement at the time. “I am overwhelmed by the outpouring of prayers, love and support for my family’s well-being.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.8115384615385><h2>Naviyd Ely Raymond</h2><p>&nbsp;Naviyd Ely Raymond is Usher’s second child with Tameka Foster.

I&nbsp;don’t want to be around all these older people!”</p><p>Usher clarified that his son “really loves entertainment.” When he was prepping for his Las Vegas residency, Naviyd would offer critiques. “He’s like, ‘You missed this thing. you didn’t do this thing.’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah that’s the point. It’s not supposed to be the same every night,’ ” Usher told Tamron Hall.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=13.02><h2>Sovereign Bo Raymond</h2><p>Sovereign Bo is Usher’s third child—his first daughter and child with longtime girlfriend Jennifer Goicoechea.
