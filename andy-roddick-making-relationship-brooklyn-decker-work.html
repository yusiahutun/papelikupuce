Brooklyn added: "And Wimbledon was when Andy's nerves and the general tension was at its highest because that was that one that he really wanted."&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=egPyBybKfv data-wc=70>On being parents to their two children, Andy previously told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Us Weekly</a>: "I think with work and kids, I think that we're a really good team. I think we know that we each try to go above and beyond with our household responsibilities and the kids. And so, I don't think we ever question either [person's] effort at all [which] leads to a kind of more of a calming situation."&nbsp;</p><p id=eMPye1xSr6 data-wc=72>But when it comes to keeping their romance alive, Andy remarked: "You have to schedule it. We do try to do a good job of saying, 'Hey, next Wednesday we're going to go out and enjoy each other.' Enjoy the silence of no children around, and enjoy not picking stuff up off the floor, unless we do it. So, scheduling matters when you’re this far out and have a couple of kids."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dn2QbWpsZ5Gjsbp50aibnaGToHqurcqipaBlopq5osDIqKWsoJmleqO%2BzqiipbGeYrGmr8qeqWavn6e4cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./conrad-tulum-riviera-maya.html><span>←</span><span>Tulum's Best New Resort + Deal</span></a>
