We’ve hung out on and off over that period of time,” the Perfect Match star told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ET</a> in April 2020. “We are friends, we are close friends.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><h2 id=h-vinny-guadagnino>Vinny Guadagnino</h2><p id=par-4_41>Farago also had a romance with Vinny Guadagnino. “He is super cool,” she said on the podcast <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Not Skinny But Not Fat</a> (per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In Touch</a>). Farago revealed that Guadagnino’s castmate, <a href=#>Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi</a>, set her up with <a href=#>the Jersey Shore star</a>.</p><p id=par-5_49>“Snooki started following me and she was commenting on my photos and I messaged her and was like ‘Can we be friends?’ and she was like ‘Yeah, I actually have a friend of mine who thinks you’re cute.’&nbsp; So that started the conversation between him and I,” Farago said.</p><p id=par-6_51>She connected easily with Guadagnino and felt they had a lot in common. “He’s like me in guy form, it’s weird,” Farago said. “He’s just this hilarious and very chill person [and] he’s pretty cute so. It’s just nice to have people around me who seem very genuine and really nice.”</p><p id=par-7_13>They were spotted having dinner together in New York City in July 2020.</p><h2 id=h-jef-holm>Jef Holm&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-8_35>On season 8 of The Bachelorette, Jef Holm competed with 24 other men for Emily Maynard’s heart. He proposed to Maynard in the finale, but their relationship ended a few months after the show aired.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_34><a href=#>Holm was linked to Francesca Farago</a> in September 2020. “Our mutual friend, Casey, introduced us a few weeks ago,” Holm told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E! News</a>, likely referring to Casey Boonstra, whom Farago also used to date.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_43>“She’s a lot of fun to be around,” the Bachelorette star gushed. “We’ve been hanging out and getting to know each other. She’s a great person inside and out and we have a lot in common. I definitely have a crush on her.”</p><p id=par-11_10>Farago and Holm were photographed kissing while on vacation together.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-casey-boonstra>Casey Boonstra</h2><p id=par-12_18>Before dating Jef Holm, Francesca Farago had a brief fling with Australian model Casey Boonstra in August 2020.</p><p id=par-13_31>Farago and Boonstra were photographed making out, and the model posted several pictures of them kissing on her Instagram Stories. “My baby,” she captioned one of the images (per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E!

The Vancouver native even moved to the UK to live with her girlfriend in London.</p><p id=par-16_31>In a May 2021 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a> video, the Perfect Match star explained the factors that contributed to <a href=#>her breakup with Sims</a>, including moving in together too quickly and having different love languages.</p><p id=par-17_50>“After the breakup, she just blocked me and deleted me and told me to leave London… I didn’t think I deserved that because I didn’t do anything wrong, and she didn’t do anything wrong,” Farago said (per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Capital FM</a>). “We just kind of fizzled and there was no more spark.”</p><p id=par-18_34>Despite their messy ending, the Too Hot to Handle star said <a href=#>she wished her ex well</a>. “I wish Demi all the best. I know she’s thriving and she just wasn’t the one for me.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><h2 id=h-tana-mongeau>Tana Mongeau</h2><p id=par-19_30><a href=#>Francesca Farago and Tana Mongeau</a> had a fling that started after the <a href=#>YouTube star slid into her DMs</a>. They kept their relationship casual and had a “friends with benefits” dynamic.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-20_42>Things got messy when Mongeau flaunted her friendship with Farago’s ex, Harry Jowsey, on TikTok (per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Seventeen</a>). Another fan asked Farago on social media if she and Mongeau were still friends, the Perfect Match star responded, “She’s friends with Harry now apparently.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><h2 id=h-harry-jowsey>Harry Jowsey</h2><p id=par-21_32>Francesca Farago <a href=#>dated fellow contestants Dom Gabriel</a>, Damian Powers, and Abbey Humphreys on Perfect Match. But before that, she famously got engaged <a href=#>to Harry Jowsey</a> on Too Hot to Handle season 1.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-22_29>Their engagement didn’t last, and the on-and-off couple called it quits for good in 2021 when, according to Farago, Jowsey was “extremely disrespectful to [her] online” (per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a>).</p><p id=par-23_47>Jowsey is currently dating Too Hot to Handle season 3 alum Georgia Hassarati, who also <a href=#>competed on Perfect Match with Farago</a>. He considered suing his ex after their breakup because, according to him, Farago was “damaging his brand” and lost him 200,000 Instagram followers (per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a>).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-5></figure><h2 id=h-jesse-sullivan>Jesse Sullivan</h2><p id=par-24_37>Farago is currently dating <a href=#>TikTok star Jesse Sullivan</a>, who mostly uses his platform to document his experience as a trans man and the parent to his teenager, Arlo.
