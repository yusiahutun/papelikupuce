Then my husband said, you need to admit to them that you had a hangover when you went to David Hockney, or when you went to Haim, you had a huge rip in your all-in-one.”</p>In one episode, visiting <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Cate Blanchett on set</span></a>, McCartney fears that a tomato soup balanced on the edge of the counter in her make-up trailer could turn into a sloppy soup disaster. In another incident, her peanut, pretzel and chocolate cookies, baked for artist George Condo at just two hours’ notice, received a raised eyebrow from her legendary father Paul – though thankfully a warm response from their intended recipient.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/27/cd973a0f-131c-4b43-8648-9a7a3d15d86d_5fd1dc70.jpg>Along with her famous family – besides Paul there’s fashion designer sister Stella – Mary McCartney was one of the founders of the Meat Free Monday movement. She also has had her own cooking programme Mary McCartney Serves It Up!, with three series under its belt, so she is well-established <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">as a plant-based chef</span></a>. This project, though, combines several of McCartney’s talents, as she approached each subjects herself, cooked for them, wrote the stories and recipes, held the camera for all of the portraits – and then eventually decided that she should shoot the food as well, which initially she had thought she’d leave to someone else.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/27/4e403878-d387-4806-9d05-1ee0423dbcb8_03b166dd.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">All of this came about rather organically, as part of the chaos that she likes to think feeds her own creativity. What started out as a blog project became a book when McCartney decided having a publisher give her a deadline would be the best way to motivate her to get things rolling. Then a change of name cemented its purpose. The original title was simply Cooking for Artists, but it became Feeding Creativity, as suggested by McCartney’s husband, writer and director Simon Aboud – a much more fitting heading, as the book feeds more than the tummy.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">12 celebrity nepo babies who became famous models, from Jennie to the Hadids</span></p></a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/27/80b762da-6730-4df2-985d-f8387289049b_e0378fdb.jpg>These nourishing recipes and stories aren’t necessarily high-concept achievements – for example, one of the simplest recipes is the Feel Good Smoothie she makes for Stella McCartney and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the Hadid sisters</span></a>, which is literally frozen berries and banana, plant-based milk and a bunch of seeds. And that’s the point, she says.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Because personally, I don’t like to be preachy and say, this is how you should eat. The purpose of me sharing my recipes is to sort of say, ‘Look, if you want to eat this way more, I’d love to share my recipes and make them simple and easy and packed full of flavour.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/27/a9ab37b9-042d-4c8c-92d9-c6f741fe4e5c_03cd35f8.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The portraits are as simple and intimate as the dishes. When Stanley Tucci opened his door for McCartney, “He was like, ‘Ah, I’m so glad it’s just you, I thought you might arrive with a film crew and loads of assistants.’ But it literally was me with the bag of food and my camera,” she remembers.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">All grown up: 7 favourite childhood treats, reimagined for adulthood</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A lot of my childhood food memories are based at home around the kitchen. We’re a very foodie family so we’d always make the kitchen the hub of the home. So often, you’d smell something good, and then end up in the kitchen, around the table, chatting with mum [the late Linda McCartney] and helping her. And her style was very much ‘look at what you have, and then make something up from it’. And it’s sort of all based around my mum, because she was very clever, she would make it interesting in the kitchen, so that you would want to be there and that way she was never on her own.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/27/dff68546-2eaa-401c-bfee-989a47c00b0f_70e0881a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This heart and soul fills Feeding Creativity, with its candid-style photography and the little handwritten notes that McCartney leaves alongside the recipes that make it seem like you’re crowding into her kitchen, peering over her shoulder, trying to get a little taste of what’s on the stove.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ultimately, while the McCartneys have very much been the poster family for the meat-free movement, each member has done it in their own way, led by his or her own inner compass.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/27/5598b073-bda2-4d9e-b8db-6bb13e13bf92_ccba7a0e.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Mary, that means bringing together disparate fluencies in cooking and photography, which to her form a fluid narrative – one that is hers alone, whether she is making a cookbook or directing a documentary about Abbey Road Studios, last year’s If These Walls Could Sing.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Fashioning The Beatles: Deirdre Kelly’s new book on Fab Four style</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think I define myself in wanting to share and make a difference and make a connection.

Why do I want to do it?” she muses.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I like connecting with people, so how will that get me off my sofa, watching TV and eating junk food, and bring me into the world? Everyone presumes I hang out with all these famous people all the time. But often I’m asked to take a portrait of someone and we haven’t met before, but having met them, I feel like we’ve had a connection. And it’s more important than me taking a picture of someone – then [the picture] is for them, too.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZqWhlprAtcXLnmalnZmowrOxjpqpraGTobJwf5FscGxvYGS6or7YZqScm5Gnwa%2Bx2GaaqKebnruoecuiqq1loJa5tHnGop6iZZGjsW6uxKWjmmWYlrGqsIycmK2dXZe5orrCoZytrF2Wu6V50q2Yp6SVrnq1wcKcoGaelZqxqrrG</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lindsay-lohan-gabrielles-gala-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Lindsay Lohan Hits The Red Carpet Bra-less for Gabrielle's Gala!</span></a>
