<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Nicki Minaj &amp;amp; Ben Shapiro Continue Their Heated Back &amp;amp; Forth</h1></header><section class=post-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hotnewhiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nicki-minaj-ben-shapiro-feud-1500x1106.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><a href=# class=text-word rel>Nicki Minaj</a> and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Sexyy Red</a> certainly impressed fans <a href=# rel>with their track "Pound Town 2."</a> Overall, this is a remix to the original track by Sexyy Red, who has become a sensation as of late. However, there are certainly some people who are haters of the track. One such person is <a href=# rel>Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro</a>, who has always had a distaste for hip-hop. He recently went on his show and did a dramatic reading of the lyrics, all while comparing it to "WAP." Secretly, we think he actually likes it.</p><p>Of course, Nicki Minaj ended up seeing this, and she made sure to offer her commentary on the matter. Taking to Twitter, the Queen wrote "Roman said leave his ass out of it sir! No pun intended." This was followed up by Sexyy Red who actually retweeted Ben Shapiro's video talking about the song. Overall, it seemed like a pretty funny moment in which Ben got dunked on. However, he must be a glutton for punishment as he kept trying to make the feud happen.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Nicki Minaj Allegedly Bit Saweetie’s Idea For “Barbie World” Track</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nicki-minaj-ben-shapiro-can-t-stop>Nicki Minaj & Ben Shapiro Can't Stop</h2></span><p>In one tweet, he wrote "Not possible, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@NICKIMINAJ</a>, since you have apparently never recorded a song that left your ass out of it." Subsequently, Minaj clapped back yet again, this time saying: "Next time I’ll be sure to add my dick. So you can suk it. Love you." Despite the clap back, Ben found time for another tweet this morning, as he said "Surprise twist: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@NICKIMINAJ</a> was the one with the anaconda all along." At this point, it remains to be seen whether Nicki feels compelled to respond to this last diss.</p><p>Either way, it has become clear that Ben Shapiro follows hip-hop closely, despite hating it so much. Although, that has been his whole M.O. this whole time. Hate things obsessively all while paying as much attention to them as possible. At the end of the day, how else will the Daily Wire get viewers?</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Nicki Minaj Posts “Ratchet Video” Of Her & Kenneth Petty For Father’s Day: Watch</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbYZ4gpVmpaKbm556rrXNmqFmmpWjerS0wKmgq6ddm7K2sA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bradford-play-centre-eight-injured-including-four-kids-after-man-breaks-into-kids-club-and-crashes-from-balcony.html><span>←</span><span>Eight injured at Alphabet Zoo in Bradford after man evading cops bursts into kids club and jumps</span></a>
