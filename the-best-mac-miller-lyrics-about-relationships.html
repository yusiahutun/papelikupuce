In the song "Circles," Miller reflects on the cyclical nature of relationships and the difficulties in breaking free from toxic patterns. He raps, "Seasons change and our love went cold / Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go / Run away, but we're running in circles."2. In "Self Care," Miller touches on the importance of prioritizing one's own well-being within a relationship. He raps, "But healing, don't forget the ceiling / Checkin' for a pulse and wonderin' if I'm still in love / It's a curse, fear, in my head, worse when I'm in bed."3. "Dang!" featuring Anderson .Paak shows Miller's introspection about love and the struggles of maintaining a healthy relationship. He sings, "We was gettin' older, tryna be the best that we could be / College kids, growin' up, that's just what it was."4. "Good News" is a poignant reflection on Miller's attempts to find happiness and peace within himself. In it, he says, "Everybody say I need rehab / 'Cause I'm speedin' with a blindfold on and won't be long / Until they watchin' me crash, and they don't wanna see that."5. The song "2009" showcases Miller's growth and reflection on past relationships. He raps, "In my own way, this feel like living / Some alternate reality / And I was drownin', but now I'm swimming / Through stressful waters to relief."6. In "Stay," Miller explores the emotional turmoil that can arise from clinging onto a relationship that is no longer fulfilling. He sings, "And I just need a way out of my head / I'll do anything for a way out / Of my head."These examples highlight the diverse range of emotions and experiences Miller navigated within the realm of relationships. From the highs and lows of love to grappling with personal growth and self-care, he offered listeners an honest and relatable perspective.
