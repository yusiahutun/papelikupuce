Kinmen has a different style from Taiwan, including traditional architecture, but it’s not always complete,” says Hwang, explaining why subsidies for restoration have been offered since 1995.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">East Asian sites of natural value given Unesco World Heritage status</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Properties that have been restored and opened as guest accommodation can be divided into three broad subtypes: courtyard homes, European-style houses and fortified coastal properties that were built to repel pirates.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Few bookings are currently being made, since restrictions introduced to curb the coronavirus pandemic have stopped international tourism and choked domestic visitor flow, but the lodgings below – examples of each of the three styles – are among those that await guests once the health crisis has passed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/03/668d24d4-30b7-4db0-af15-e7bd5aaf155a_38186896.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><br>Courtyard homes</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An eight-minute walk from Kinmen’s main road and 10 minutes from a beach, the Hu Feng Ancient Stay – five rooms spread over what were once three separate homes around its courtyard – will appeal to tourists once international travel restarts, says Yang.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He took a NT$1.93 million (US$70,000) subsidy and added his own money to hire a local architect to redesign everything from the roof downwards.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s really suitable for a guest house,” says Yang, 60, who looks forward to chatting, in the spirit of a traditional Taiwanese innkeeper, with guests as they come and go through the courtyard.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As with most three-chamber courtyard houses, the brick-floored yard is cosy and sits right outside every guest’s door.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The guestrooms stand out for their log ceiling beams and red-brick walls. The windows offer enough ventilation that guests shouldn’t need their air conditioners most of the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/03/aa886e94-ad69-4074-9c89-57599269ddce_9282609f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 860 square metre Louzaixia Gucuo Bed & Breakfast – one of 82 found inside the Kinmen National Park and built 140 years ago – is an example of lodgings that have been sculpted from a four-chamber courtyard complex rather than the more common three.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Twelve guestrooms – the largest of which can sleep 14 people – are spread across three traditional Fujianese-style buildings. The fourth building is a public space.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The courtyard takes on the ambience of a cafe terrace when guests sit there and drink tea.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong travellers on their nightmares after quarantine rule change</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We would have all these people now if not for the pandemic, so we’re hoping that goes away,” says Tsai Yin-chieh, a member of the agricultural family that has owned the property for generations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From the outside, the Louzaixia looks like an old “academy”, or small university building, Tsai says. Inside, wood features heavily; the ceilings have a log-cabin feel. Log beams are a hallmark of old Fujianese homes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/03/873ac933-0ba9-4b4c-b4ae-b8dd06fd57b3_e18049fa.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">A European-style home</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The three-storey Yu Yuan B&B wouldn’t look out of place overlooking the Mediterranean. Romanesque columns frame a gleaming exterior; the management calls this property the “little White House”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Retrofitted in 2016, Yu Yuan is an example of old Kinmen houses known as “overseas buildings”, meaning those influenced by Western rather than Fujianese architectural styles. Some were built in the Baroque style, for example.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Unesco can’t protect World Heritage sites – just look at China</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Western architecture began to appear in Kinmen in the mid-19th century and gained in popularity in the 1930s as islanders travelled to Southeast Asia seeking work, according to the Kinmen National Park archives. They would send money back for home renovation, fostering “architectures with much exotic design”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Carefully restored it may be, but Yu Yuan’s 14 guestrooms wouldn’t originally have had 55-inch TV screens and air conditioning.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We’re the first guest house in Kinmen with a foreign-style exterior and outfitted with modern amenities on the inside,” claims a member of the Lee family, which has owned the property for generations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/03/e1bd3afd-150b-42a5-8200-f15c49837d15_eb537f18.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Pirate-proof accommodation</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Today, Kinmen’s villages open onto sorghum fields, wooded hillsides and views of the ocean, beyond which, to the west, are visible the skyscrapers of the mainland Chinese city of Xiamen. Shuitou 34 Hao Homestay conjures up memories of the pirates who would come pillaging from that direction in the 19th century.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We had real pirates coming in from mainland China,” says owner Lee Bi-yin, whose family of merchants has lived in the property for four generations. The metal gate and the metal-framed upper-floor windows of the building were installed to keep those invaders out, says Lee. A two-storey end unit resembles a squarish castle turret.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/03/2431b231-64fc-437f-b761-d1720283ac6b_38186896.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The property – which has a courtyard painted white with a blue trim – was retrofitted as a seven-room guest house 13 years ago.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shuitou 34 is a few minutes’ walk away from the pier from which ferries sail to Kinmen’s second-largest and only other populated island, Little Kinmen, which is characterised by parkland and fortresses used by the Nationalists for defence before the 1970s.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The property’s fortified exterior, location and piracy theme attracted guests to Shuitou 34 before Covid-19 suppressed tourism. Lee says she has begun regular disinfections of the accommodation to convince visitors that her homestay is safe, whenever they return.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/03/37f2bcb8-0daf-4ed8-a2c7-1cad21c8d8cd_f60200c9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Recently, the Kinmen county incentive programme has given extra financial assistance to historical guest house operators whose income has fallen below 2018 levels because of travel restrictions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">About 400,000 visitors from mainland China, the chief source of tourism before Covid-19 struck, took ferries over to Kinmen from Xiamen in 2018. That number had been steadily increasing since 2011, when people in Fujian were allowed to make the direct, 20-minute crossing. None may visit currently.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Taiwanese tourists, many of them families interested in history, gave guest house proprietors a bit of business until April this year, but rising coronavirus case numbers in mid-May halted most domestic travel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When tourists do return, Hwang would like younger travellers and parents with children to be among their number. He has asked tourism industry operators to research ways in which Kinmen – including its guest houses – might appeal to such visitors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We’re always looking forward to the reopening,” he says.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZMGzrdWeo2aklZ7Atr7EaJirrJmYuaZ7kmprcGxkZ3yptdKtpquhk2K1sMHSnqpmo5mjuqa6jKKqpZmemXq1rciwmKdloprAtbvRnptmn6WawLV5x6isrJ2j</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./red-white-and-royal-blue-sequel-plans-exclusive.html><span>←</span><span>Exclusive: Red, White &amp;amp; Royal Blue sequel plans is there a second novel or film on the way?</span></a>
