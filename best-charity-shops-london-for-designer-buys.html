But if you're in the capital and on the hunt for occasion wear, the Primrose Hill shop ought to be your first port of call. The boutique, elevated approach means that prices are definitely on the more expensive end of the spectrum, although I did spot some pairs of jeans by Frame and Citizens of Humanity at just beyond the £10.00 mark. Other highlights include Gucci tinted shades and non-traditional Burberry trenches.</p><p id=e-dtvfxipt_ data-wc=7><strong>Where: 109 Regent's Park Road, NW1 8UR</strong></p><h2><strong>Traid, Westbourne Grove</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/e010ccefed13-traid171216630933382153583665736361061838768.jpg><p id=ecMIFrSQph data-wc=56>Committed to tackling problems related to clothing overconsumption, <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Traid</a> donates its proceeds to "global projects improving conditions and working practices in the textile industry".
