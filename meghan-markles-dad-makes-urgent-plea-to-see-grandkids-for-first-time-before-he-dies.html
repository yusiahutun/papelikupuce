He recently had a brush with death after suffering a stroke, and it’s sparked his mission to meet his grandkids. Thomas suffered a stroke in May 2022 and was rushed to hospital. He lost the ability to speak for sometime amid his <a href=#>health</a> recovery. However, after a long road, he’s now able to speak out, where he’s making an urgent plea to the Duchess of Sussex.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-thomas-markle-meghan-please-let-me-meet-archie-and-lilibet>Thomas Markle – ‘Meghan, please let me meet Archie and Lilibet’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-12.56.52-1024x556.png><p>The heartbroken dad spoke on Good Morning Britain, where he made the desperate plea to his daughter.</p><p>After undergoing intense speech therapy since his stroke, he says this Live <a href=#>TV</a> bid is an attempt to reach the <a href=#>royal</a>.</p><p>In his emotional interview, he also mentioned <a href=#>King Charles</a>, and how he hasn’t been able to spend much time with <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and Meghan Markle’s children since they flew over the Atlantic.</p><p>He said: “This is a vow. I want to see my grandkids. I think King Charles will also like to see his grandkids as well.”</p><p>After his health took a turn, he claims he hasn’t spoken to either of the Sussexes. He adds neither of them reached out. Thomas explains the last time he spoke to his daughter Meghan Markle was before she was <a href=#>Harry’s blushing bride</a> in 2018.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-s-a-cruel-thing-to-do>‘It’s a cruel thing to do’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-12.56.41-569x1024.png><p>The 79-year-old, who is about to turn the big 8-0 next year, is upset by the parents’ choice to cut him out.</p><p>He added: “This is a cruel thing to do to a grandparent. Not to just me, but to the King of England as well, to deny the right to see a grandchild.”</p><p>TV host Susanna Reid <a href=# rel=nofollow>admitted</a> she previously was unsure on Mr Markle’s previous experiences, but that’s now changed. She confessed: “We have interviewed you a number of times over the past few years. I have to admit I have had ambivalent feelings about it because every member of a family is entitled to not speak to another member of their family, if they feel wounded and hurt.</p><p>“Then when the book came out [Spare] and the six-part <a href=#>Netflix</a> documentary came out, I think I changed my view a little bit. They are very open about the rifts in the family, and they have not remained quiet, and so I think you are entitled to speak about family relations and rifts.</p><p>“I know that you don’t have direct contact, I can understand you want to use television channels to get your message across. Meghan, of course, is entitled to heed or not heed what you say. If she is watching, if she does hear, what would you like to hear from you directly?”</p><p>Thomas continued: “Put the past behind us and allow me to see my grandkids. In California, I can actually sue to see them, I don’t want to do that.</p><p>“The other thing is, I have done nothing wrong.</p><p>“There’s nothing that points to me that I’ve done, matter of fact I was a loving father. She knows that. There’s no excuse for Harry to treat me this way.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meet-meghan-and-harry-s-children>Meet Meghan and Harry’s children</h2><p>Meghan welcomed little <a href=#>Archie</a> in 2019.

But, Meghan Markle’s dad Thomas hasn’t met the little prince or princess.</p><p>Harry and Meghan shared never-before-seen home videos of their children in their Netflix docuseries. Fans got to see the youngster running on the beach, through a corn maze, and seeing the snow with mom Meghan.</p><p>Although the couple has not officially confirmed if they’ll expand the family more, but they previously <a href=# rel=nofollow>expressed</a> smaller families were better for the planet.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2aGcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y56qZpyRmXqurcqeqmatopyyr8CMqaOemV2pvG6%2FxJ5koKqRo7GstcOsZJ%2BnomKzqr7SrWStoZ2aeqOxxaipnmWYmnqltcSsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kevin-neal-named-president-at-buddy-lee-attractions.html><span>←</span><span>Kevin Neal Named President At Buddy Lee Attractions</span></a>
