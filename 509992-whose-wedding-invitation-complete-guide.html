Regardless of your creativity, the wording on a wedding invitation must always follow a specific format. For example, a wedding invitation must have the first and middle names of the bride and groom.

Traditionally, the wedding hosts were the parents whose names appeared on the host line.</p><p class=align-left>In modern days, the host line includes the names of the bride and groom or a combination of the bride’s parents and groom’s parents. So, if you follow the modern format with only the bride and groom's names, does the man or woman's name go first on wedding invitations?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bb4cbae37463a402.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Couple Causes Online Stir After Choosing Their Cat as Wedding&nbsp;Witness</span></p></a><h2>Whose name goes first on a wedding invitation?</h2><p class=align-left>Traditionally, the bride’s name came first on a wedding invitation. That tradition has continued for a long time. However, there are instances where the groom’s name is first.</p><p class=align-left>In ancient times, the bride’s parents usually issued invitations. Thus, they used the first and middle names of the bride on the <a href=#>wedding invitations</a>. However, the groom’s name was usually listed in full. Also, the groom’s title was included in the wording.</p><p class=align-left>Today, there are situations where the bride and groom are the wedding hosts and require no input from parents. In this case, the couple can decide which name should come first on the wedding invitation. Also, they decide whether to use titles as part of the wording.</p><h2>Why does the bride's name go first?</h2><p class=align-left>If you follow the traditional format, the bride’s name goes first on the wedding invitation because her parents are usually the hosts. Thus, they take the prestige of having their daughter’s name first because they pay a significant share of the expenses.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/22474364d2a9d623.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kisii Couple Who Went to Same Schools, Pursued Same Degrees, Wed after 10 Years</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Where the bride’s parents are the hosts, they can also include the names of the groom’s parents. However, the names of the groom’s parents come second. In this instance, the wording on a wedding invitation may be as follows:</p>Alice & Michael Moore and Peter & Jane Lamb invite you to celebrate with their children, Grace & John, on their wedding day.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bb4cbae37463a402.jpg><p class=align-left>In the above example, Alice and Michael Moore are the bride’s parents; Peter and Jane Lamb are the groom’s parents, and Grace and John are the bride and groom.</p><p class=align-left>In other wedding invitation examples where the bride and the groom are the hosts, the names of their parents are usually excluded. For example:</p>With great honour, we, Grace and John, invite you to celebrate our marriage.<p class=align-left>The bride and groom may also decide to go against tradition. In other words, the groom’s name may come first instead of the bride’s. For example:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e0568fd37549411f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Groom Angers Friends Invites Only 3 People to His Wedding</span></p></a>John and Alice invite you to celebrate their marriage on Saturday, 24 June 2023.<p class=align-left>Some societies also prefer to include the groom’s name first because he is marrying the bride. In this case, the wording may also be different. For example:</p>John Lamb invites friends and families as he marries Alice Moore.<p class=align-left>The above two wedding invitation wording examples are different and go against tradition. Thus, many people prefer sticking to the tradition of making the bride’s name first on the wedding invitation.</p><h2>How names can be addressed on wedding invitations</h2><p class=align-left>You can address names on wedding invitations in unique ways. Traditionally, many wedding<a href=#> invitation cards</a> used the titles of each individual. The common titles are Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr, Hon, and Eng.</p><p class=align-left>The easiest way is to use Mr when inviting a male guest, followed by their full name. For female guests, use Ms followed by their full name. An exception comes when inviting a married couple.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9883d1ebd02c087e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Newspapers Review: Mama Lucy Hospital Sued after Offering Male Baby to Lady Who Delivered Female Newborn</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In that case, you can address the duo as Mr and Mrs followed by their full names. If you plan to invite a politician, it is best to address them by their titles. For example, you can use Senator, Hon, Gov, or Your Excellency.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/22474364d2a9d623.png><p class=align-left>The tricky part comes when inviting widowed or divorced women. In this case, asking them how they should be addressed would be best. For a widowed woman, address them by using the honorific Mrs and her married name if she changed her <a href=#>last name </a>to her husband’s or her maiden name if she never changed it.</p><p class=align-left>For a divorced woman, you must determine whether she kept her married name. If she still has her married name, use Mrs to address her. But if she uses her maiden name, the best way is to use Ms along with her first and maiden name.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d119bf4d5c4a6068.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nigerian Music Mogul Regrets Spending Millions on Grand Wedding to Ex-Wife: "My Biggest Mistake"</span></p></a><h2>How many lines are in a wedding invitation?</h2><p class=align-left>A wedding invitation can have as many or as fewer lines as possible. But when following the traditional format, the card has six lines, including:</p><ul><li>Host line – The people hosting the wedding, typically the bride’s parents.</li><li>Request line – Asking the invited people to attend the wedding.</li><li>Bride and groom names – The bride's first name followed by the groom's full name.</li><li>Date and time of the event – The date and time of the wedding.</li><li>The location of the event – The location of the wedding.</li><li>The reception location – The reception location is optional but should be included as the last line.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Understand that the lines may be fewer, especially if the hosts are the bride and groom and you include the event's data, time, and location on the same line. But sticking to the traditional format is much better.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5a9538922d2eb942.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is the girl in the T-Mobile commercial in 2023?
