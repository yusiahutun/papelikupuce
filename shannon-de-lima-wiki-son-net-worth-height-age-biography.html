Here you will be saturated with all that we have collected about her biography, her fortune, and other relatively unknown details about this amazing woman.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Shannon De Lima Biography (Age)</strong></h2><p>She couldn’t have come from anywhere else with all her gorgeous looks and glamour, if not from Venezuela, the country of models. She was born on 6 January 1988 and grew up in her home country. From an early age, Shannon had a fondness for modeling that continued into her adult life.</p><p>Shannon has not revealed any details about her parents, such as their names and where they are currently staying.

She also participated in the Caracas Fashion Beach Show, which took place the following year in 2006. Since then, her career flourished with her move to the USA, where she signed many profitable contracts and was recognized as a fashion designer who owns a swimwear line that she writes about in her fashion blog.</p><p>In the model-making industry, she still enjoys respect in her own field and is very much in demand.

Her first marriage was with a Venezuelan actor named Coko Manuel Sosa, for whom she gave birth to a son on 29 October 2007. Her son’s name is Daniel Alejandro Sosa De Lima. It was not revealed what caused their separation from Coko, or maybe they were not officially married.</p><p>She moved with her son into Marc Antony’s house in the Dominican Republic when she married him in 2014 after their wedding at Anthony’s La Romana. They had been together since 2012, and their wedding was well attended by a few hand-picked crème de la crème of the Latin American celebrity world. Stars like Tito El Bambino, Luis Guerra, and Carlos Vives all took part in the event of the era. Shannon became his third wife because he was married before and had children. The couple announced their separation on 26 November 2016, shortly after two years of marriage.</p><p>While married to Marc, her son had stepbrothers and stepsisters, including the twins of Jennifer Lopez, Max and Emme, Cristian, Ryan, Ariana, Chase of Dayanara Torres, and Debbie Rosado.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Height</strong></h2><p>Since she is a model, and a successful one at that, you should expect from Shannon De Lima a good height and the best body characteristics.
