While she hasn’t posted to Instagram in more than 6 weeks, fans have taken to the comments section to demand a statement from her. “The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">silence is so loud Miranda</a>.. seriously disappointed,” one wrote. “I’m looking at you weird until you speak out about the quiet on set…,” wrote another.</p><p>“My name is <a href=# id=auto-tag_drake-bell data-tag=drake-bell>Drake Bell</a> and I came here today to tell my story,” Bell says during the documentary’s third episode. In one instance of his interview, he revealed that he was <a href=#>sexually abused by Peck</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/josh-peck-drake-bell.png><p>“I was sleeping on the couch where I would usually sleep. I woke up to him — I opened my eyes, I woke up and he was sexually assaulting me. I froze and was&nbsp;<a href=#>in complete shock</a>&nbsp;and had no idea what to do or how to react, and I have no idea how to get out of this situation,” Bell said, who was 15 years old at the time. Peck was “so apologetic,” saying it would never happen again.</p><p>“He figured out how to convince my mom and everyone around to, anytime I would have an audition or anytime I needed to work on dialogue or anything, I somehow ended up back at Brian’s house and it just got worse and worse and worse and worse. I was<a href=#>&nbsp;just trapped.</a>&nbsp;I had no way out,” said Bell. “The abuse was extensive and it got pretty brutal. I don’t know how to elaborate on that on camera, really… Why don’t you think of the worst stuff that someone could do to somebody as a sexual assault, and then I’ll answer your question. I don’t know how else to put it.”</p><p>Fans have also slammed Josh Peck for staying silent. His most recent Instagram post, shared four days before the documentary premiered on Investigation Discovery on March 17, is flooded with comments&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>from fans calling for him to say something</a>.</p><p>However, it seems like Drake and Josh severed their ties some time ago. In 2017, it was revealed that Drake hadn’t been invited to Josh’s wedding. “When you’re not invited to the wedding the message is clear,” he wrote, leaving no confusion as to whom he was referring. In another tweet, he added: “True colors have come out today. Message is loud and clear.” Drake’s tweets have since been deleted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lm1oam9oZLqqvsCnm5plk6TAqL7Or5xmnKKWuKZ5wZ6jpWWSp7aiuoypnJyjXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./diy-leg-scrub-1113459.html><span>←</span><span>DIY Leg Scrub Recipes to Get Your Gams in Gear for Summer</span></a>
