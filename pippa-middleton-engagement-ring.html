Asscher cuts are uniquely clear and require a high clarity, so if this were of top quality, this would fetch in excess of £200,000."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3b2d0948755b-pippa-middleton-ring-a.jpg><p class=text-center id=eE_A3iusLcZHV data-wc=10><strong class=redactor-inline-converted>James Matthews proposed with a stunning vintage rock © FameFlynet</strong></p><p id=eYkgcnkzLPjsx data-wc=30>A source confirmed to <strong class=redactor-inline-converted>HELLO!</strong> that the pretty brunette is to marry her boyfriend James, a hedge fund manager and the older brother of star Spencer Matthews.</p><p id=earnUzSltI6bj data-wc=32>The happy news comes less than a year after the couple first started dating, with reports stating that James popped the question last weekend during a romantic break in the Lake District.</p><p id=exCktVFK4MluW data-wc=41>The engagement, which is said to have taken Pippa by complete surprise, has delighted her family.
