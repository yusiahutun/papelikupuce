Most drugstore face washes strip your skin of its natural moisture, making the skin dehydrated, tight, and dull. Hence, to ensure your skin’s needs are met, it is important to get your hands on the best dry-skin face washes to hydrate and mollycoddle it.&nbsp;</p><p>“For dry and sensitive skin, you want to look for more creamy, non-foaming cleansers”, says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Jenny Liu. Such products give a rich, creamy lather and are gentler, and help maintain your skin’s pH levels while also cleansing it adequately. There are two types of moisturizing agents you need to look for in a dry skin face wash — a humectant that boosts your skin’s water content, and an occlusive to prevent trans-epidermal water loss. And, a good cleanser will provide these benefits without leaving a sticky residue on your skin. Besides, it is best to look for facial cleansers with a soap-free formula to protect your skin’s lipid barrier.&nbsp;</p><p>Our contributor Bart Nanka, Executive at Mudbrick Herb Cottage - a herbal brand, says, “People with dry skin should avoid harsh chemicals like sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and alcohol in face washes. They tend to strip natural oils from the skin, causing dryness to worsen. This is a unique case for those with acne, as many acne medications contain those ingredients. Instead, opt for gentle, natural cleansers with soothing ingredients like chamomile or aloe vera.”&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>To help you shop for the right facial cleanser, we have curated a list of our favorite product picks.

Hence, your dry skin face wash must be rich in humectants, emollients, and occlusives — to boost hydration, seal in natural moisture, and soften the skin’s texture.&nbsp;</p><p>Our contributor Bart Nanka, says, “One must look for products with humectants like glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and aloe vera, which draw moisture into the skin. Occlusives like shea butter and jojoba oil also help lock in moisture, providing a protective barrier between your skin & your environment.”</p><p><strong>Texture:</strong> Texture also plays a crucial role in selecting the best face wash for dry skin. Look for creamy or gel cleansers rather than foam-based ones. Foaming cleansers tend to be more drying and can strip away the natural oils from your skin, leaving it feeling even dry and tight. Creamy or gel cleansers, on the other hand, are gentle and provide a more moisturizing effect, leaving your skin feeling soft and supple.</p><p><strong>Gentle Exfoliants Go a Long Way:</strong> People with dry and sensitive skin types often skip exfoliating their faces as the abrasive action can be too harsh for them. Hence, it always helps if their face wash contains chemical exfoliants such as glycolic acid or lactic acid to gently get rid of dead skin cells and sebum plugs from the skin. Also, these ingredients give an even tone to the skin and reveal your radiant complexion.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Soap-free Formulation:</strong>&nbsp; Soap-based products often contain SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) or SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) that give a cleansing “sensation” to your skin. However, these products are harsh for dry and sensitive skin types if used in excess amounts. While it is best to look for sulfate-free formulations in your cleansers, even if you’re using such products, ensure you don’t apply it to your face more than once in two days for the best results.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>So, there you have it! The above-mentioned products are some of the best face washes for dry skin types. These products are highly and positively reviewed by their users and are anecdotally proven to nourish, moisturize and pamper dry and sensitive skin. Ensure you refer to our buying guide and read the ingredients list of the products before investing.
