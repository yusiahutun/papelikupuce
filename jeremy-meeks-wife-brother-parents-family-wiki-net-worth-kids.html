He became popular after he was tagged Operation Ceasefire after his arrest during a gang search in Stockton, California in 2014. As usual, the cops took a mug shot of him, but the picture found its way into social media and spread virally. Jeremy’s good looks made all the right tongues wag.</p><p>He was arrested for a major crime of street terrorism as well as for an offense of resistance/obstruction of justice. He was imprisoned at the Mendota Federal Correctional Institution but was released in March 2016, which prompted him to start his career as a model.</p><p>During his 27-month prison sentence, Meeks was soon branded a “hot criminal” in the media and signed a modeling contract with White Cross Management. During his time behind bars, he was picked up by talent agent Gina Rodriguez. In February 2017, he made an appearance during New York Fashion Week, which subsequently became his catwalk debut. He made an unprecedented appearance for Vogue magazine, which earned him the unsurprising nickname “buff bad boy”.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Life, Death and Career Achievements of Caleb Logan – The Bratayley YouTuber</a></strong></p><p>In June 2017, he was invited to Milan Fashion Week, which led to him being one of the models on the Milan catwalk as an employee of world-famous German fashion designer Phillip Plein.</p><p>After his heroic deeds in Milan in February 2017, he appeared in August 2017 in a campaign for the Israeli sunglasses fashion house “Carolina Lemke”, partly owned by Bar Refaeli, a well-known name in Israeli fashion.
