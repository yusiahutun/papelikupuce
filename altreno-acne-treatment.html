Like gossipy (supposed) friends and fights with your mother, it’s one of those things that unfortunately isn’t relegated to teenage years. In fact, according to the Journal of American Academy of Dermatology, 54 percent of women older than age 25 have some facial acne. But just as blowups with mom and backhanded compliments take on new dimensions in your 20s, 30s and 40s, so too do breakouts and blemishes. We talked to Joshua Zeichner, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, all about adult acne, how it differs from other types of breakouts, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.altreno.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Altreno (tretinoin) Lotion, 0.05%" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Altreno (tretinoin) Lotion, 0.05%</a>, a uniquely formulated topical treatment you should have on your radar.</p><h2 data-node-id=1 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The 411 on Adult Acne</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Acne is the result of a chain reaction that begins with overactivity of the oil glands. “Think of hair follicles or pores as the pipes that transfer oil from sebaceous glands to the surface of the skin,” says Dr. Zeichner. The more oil produced, the more likely it is to trap dead skin cells and gum up those pipes. When blockages occur, it creates the perfect condition for acne-causing bacteria to flourish. Inflammation soon follows, as do the red, inflamed, painful bumps we all know as acne.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While experts haven’t quite solved the puzzle of why all of this happens in adults specifically, <strong>the prevailing theories suggest that changing hormones within the body coupled with a genetic predisposition drive breakouts</strong>, Dr. Zeichner explains. “Oil glands may also be involved in the production of hormones or the conversion of testosterone to its more active—aka acne-triggering—form.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One of the main challenges in treating adult acne is that adults often have drier skin on the surface even if the sebaceous glands underneath are pumping out excess pore-clogging oil, Dr. Zeichner explains. That can complicate treatment given that many pimple-fighting products and prescriptions either target oil or are extremely drying as a side effect.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The Derm-Recommended Adult Acne Treatment</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Prescription topical retinoids—and tretinoin, specifically—are textbook examples of treatments known for drying out skin. They’re also known for being powerful and effective. <strong>“Topical retinoids have been a foundational and mainstay treatment because they act like pipe cleaners for your skin,”</strong> Dr. Zeichner says. “And tretinoin is perhaps the most studied prescription topical retinoid we have.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And if you're wondering whether retinoids are the same thing as retinol, that would be a hard no. Both are derived from vitamin A, but retinoids are clinically proven and FDA-approved to fight acne, and retinol is not.</p><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Altreno (tretinoin) Lotion, 0.05%</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="LEARN MORE for Altreno (tretinoin) Lotion, 0.05%" data-href=https://www.altreno.com/ data-product-url=https://www.altreno.com/ data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-call-to-action="LEARN MORE" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.altreno.com/ data-vars-ga-product-id=0cc3941e-9313-468c-998d-4ff98aaeeabc data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=c55a08ac-4f0b-42f3-8424-b4022054343e data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Altreno (tretinoin) Lotion, 0.05%" title="Altreno (tretinoin) Lotion, 0.05%" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1617714647-altreno-45g-v3-1617714586.png width=1974 height=1947 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Altreno (tretinoin) Lotion, 0.05%</h2></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ready for results with less dryness? <strong>Prescription <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.altreno.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Altreno class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Altreno</a> combines clinical-strength tretinoin with skin-friendly hyaluronic acid, natural collagen, and glycerin in a lightweight yet hydrating lotion formula that minimizes irritation, dryness, and other side effects.</strong> In fact, in a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bauschhealth.com/Portals/25/Pdf/PI/altreno-pi.pdf data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="clinical trial" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">clinical trial</a> conducted with Altreno, only 4 percent of those using Altreno reported dry skin. Although it is approved to treat acne in people as young as 9, “it addresses the specific needs of adult skin with breakouts,” Dr. Zeichner says. It's also just as important to note what Altreno doesn't contain—namely: silicones, alcohol, or fragrance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another factor that makes the formula unique: It disperses ingredients in a microscopic honeycomb-like mesh delivery system, which allows for even distribution of both the active and hydrating ingredients while still feeling like a lightweight lotion, making it perfect for layering under makeup. <strong>“When a doctor prescribes a brand name medication versus a generic, there’s a reason for that—these drugs are more than just their active ingredients,” he says. </strong>“So it’s important to talk to your doctor and ask for certain prescriptions by name.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dr. Zeichner says his patients have had great results with Altreno, including those with sensitive skin. “It’s a home run for those who felt they couldn’t previously use retinoids or who became too dry or irritated with other formulas.” And in studies, it reduced acne by about 50% by week 12.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Important safety information you should know about Altreno is included below, but you'll also want to discuss it with your healthcare provider.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How to Incorporate Altreno Into Your Skincare Routine</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">First, your dermatologist may ask you to discontinue use of other potent treatment products that remove dead skin cells like alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids. If your derm thinks that Altreno is right for you, they'll likely suggest that you start with a pea-sized amount over your entire face after cleansing. Don't be shy about checking back in with your doctor once you start—for example, if you feel you need additional moisture, they may suggest adding a more hydrating moisturizer to your routine. As with most tretinoin treatments, you'll probably start by using Altreno every other evening, especially if you have very sensitive skin. Again, your dermatologist will give you specific instructions.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>“My approach with skincare is usually to treat, repair, and hydrate skin in the evening and to protect skin and prevent damage with sunscreen and antioxidants in the morning,” says Dr. Zeichner. </strong>But the Altreno formulation does give you the flexibility to use it in the morning or evening because it's been tested in clinical trials for both AM and PM applications.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then, stay the course, applying Altreno every day or evening. <strong>“Using topical retinoids is like training for a marathon,” Dr. Zeichner says. </strong>“You don’t wake up and expect to be able to run 26 miles, and the same is true of results from a retinoid. Stick with it and you’ll see improvement after consistent use for several weeks.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ready to learn more?
