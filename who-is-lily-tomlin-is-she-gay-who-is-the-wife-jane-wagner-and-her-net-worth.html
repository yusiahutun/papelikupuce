There was no mention of a man she might have dated or married, which leads to speculation about her sexuality.</p><p>Tomlin is gay and married to her wife Jane Wagner, her partner for more than four decades.

Although the sexuality of the star of The Grace and Frankie is not something she wanted to reveal to the public. In one of her interviews in 2015, Lily Tomlin said that her witty and sweet mother would have “literally” died if she had turned out to be gay during her lifetime.</p><p>It was reported that Time Magazine offered her a cover in 1975 if she came out. Despite encouragement from fans at the time, she refused on the grounds that she was not interested in being typed as a gay celebrity.</p><p>As for her view on marriage, Tomlin said that you don’t really have to get married, but that it is “terribly beautiful” and many people she knows who are married are happy and delighted about it. She expressed that it would mean more if they [she and Wagner] had children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kxKm7jKKqZqSZocZuwM6mo6KmXZ7Abr%2FHnmSgmalixKm7jKKqZqyYmnq4tcWeZKOZnpp6uK3Gp5yrZZGjsW60xKtkp52kYsSwvtOhZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./425495-the-top-10-hottest-greek-women-swoon-2021-html.html><span>←</span><span>The top 10 hottest Greek women you will swoon over in 2021</span></a>
