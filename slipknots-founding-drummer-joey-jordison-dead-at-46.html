The degenerative condition impaired his ability to use drums and eventually progressed to the loss of the use of his left leg, but he was able to recover through medical intervention and physical rehab. It is unclear if his passing was connected with his neurological condition.</p><p>In addition to Slipknot, Jordison was a touring member of several major metal bands, and performed live with acts such as Metallica, when Lars Ulrich was ill, Korn, including five shows at Download, Satyricon, and Rob Zombie.</p><p>Jordison was also a member of the horror-punk band Murderdolls, which recorded a pair of studio albums before parting ways in 2011.</p><p>Following Jordison’s passing, his family said they plan to hold a private funeral service and requested privacy from fans and the media.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ35wfJZoaXBno6G2sbfNqKusZZakwq%2BwyKeeZpyiqrqusdFmoaidqWK3sL7Doqqopl2ZsqKwjJqrZmxmZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meghan-markle-nose-plastic-surgery-trend.html><span>←</span><span>Meghan Markle's Nose Inspires Plastic Surgery Trends</span></a>
