The contested video is still accessible on Ashley’s account and is still going viral on TikTok. When Ashley first began publishing on the network in 2020, it was only a few seconds long and was taken utilizing the selfie mode.</p><p>Ashley jumps on her bed with her knees bent in the popular video, which has nearly 200 million views. She then lands on a tripod. Naturally, she had no intention of getting the tripod tangled between her legs, but the incident garnered so much attention that she became known as the “Tripod Video Girl.”</p><p>Ashley revealed what happened in 2020 while appearing on the OnlyStand podcast by Barstool; at the time, she had just joined TikTok.

She was shocked to learn that it received around 80 million views the following day and is still being seen and enjoyed by TikTok users. The video has currently received over 199 million views.</p><h3><strong>A</strong><strong>shley Matheson Age</strong></h3><p>Reportedly born in 2001, Ashley Matheson is currently 22 years old as of May 2023.</p><h3><strong>Ashley Matheson Family</strong></h3><p>Ashley Matheson is the daughter of Deanna Matheson and Ron Matheson.

I got back into dance in high school and started modeling. Going into the end of my high school career, I had been really into making trillers with my friends but never posted them. One day when I was scrolling through my Instagram stories I saw one of my friends post a story of her doing a TikTok dance to the song “Envy Me” which was really popular at the time and I downloaded the app. I started by posting dance videos to friends only. After a month or so I started posting publicly, and about two months after that I had a small following of about 10k.”</p><p>Back then she credited the “put a finger down” video on her TikTok for her success which garnered over 43 million views and 4.2 million likes. She also added that her dream collaborator was Emma Chamberlain because she was intrigued by her personality.</p><p>In addition to a career as a model and influencer, she was also attempting to establish a career in music and was working on an EP back in 2020.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Ashley Matheson Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>In 2023, Ashley Matheson’s net worth is likely under $100 thousand.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Ashley Matheson Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Ashley Matheson’s birthday is not currently available.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Ashley Matheson From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Ashley Matheson is originally from <span class=xt0psk2>Ottawa, Ontario.&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Ashley Matheson On Instagram And Facebook?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yes, you can find Ashley Matheson on Facebook (<a href=#>@ashley.matheson.319</a>) and Instagram (<a href=#>@smashedely</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmmquYobK6ecyaq6Gdo6S7br%2FMmqqhnZSaubp5waKmZpmXmnqnrcyio7JllJbBqrrGaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./662be536e2704ee5748b4635-html.html><span>←</span><span>Valencia CF: El Valencia casi duplica el plazo previsto por el arquitecto Mark Fenwick para acabar e</span></a>
