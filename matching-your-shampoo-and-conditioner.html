Ever since I can remember, I've always paired my shampoo with the brand's corresponding conditioner. And if my conditioner runs out before I make it to the end of the shampoo bottle? I'm guilty of ditching what's left for a fresh set.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But, is it actually necessary to keep your shampoo and conditioner's brand monogamous, or is it ok to mix and match? Has my neuroticism acted as justification for being wasteful with my hair products? I turned to three Honey Artist hairstylists to find out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The answer is unanimous: While it can be beneficial depending on the ingredients of the set you're using and your hair's needs, it isn't necessary to use a matching duo. "Companies often design one with the other in mind. So yes, it is beneficial to use both, but not necessary," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Wesley O'Meara</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, if you can cocktail your shampoo and conditioner, how should you go about picking the perfect pair for your strands? "If you do mix brands, try to find products with complimenting technologies," suggests <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Corey Tuttle</a>. "For example, if you do have dry hair, you want extra moisture all around. While the same brand combo gives you that conveniently, hydrating formulas from different labels work fine too."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Along with hair type, considering your texture can also lead to future good hair days. "Mixing and matching for hair texture is a great idea," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Tyler Colton</a>. "So many brands don't carry shampoos or conditioners that would precisely target what you might need. If you have thick hair or curly hair you might need products with more moisture and some product lines may not offer what you need."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When you break it down, it's really about getting your hair clean, so finding the combination that works best for your strands—whether or not they come from the same brand—should be your priority. "The best reason to mix shampoos and conditioners is to find ones that will give your ideal cleansing and conditioner properties for your hair," explains Colton. "If you have fine colored hair you will need a gentle shampoo for color treated hair and then you'll need a leave-in conditioner or light conditioner so that you're fine hair isn't weighed down, often you can't find what you need in the same brand." The Best Clarifying Shampoos, According to 5 Hair Pros.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My favorite shampoo to get a clarified effect is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Shu Uemura's Cleansing Oil Shampoo for Normal Hair,</a>" says Brian Zinno, Senior Education Director at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Antonio Prieto Salon</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I've used this shampoo and can attest to the fact that it provides your hair with a deep cleanse without leaving it feeling limp and lifeless.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Infused with apple cider, this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Fekkai Apple Cider Shampoo</a> is a silicone-free purifying cleanser that clarifies and removed buildup and toxins that build up over time," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Honey Artists</a> hairstylist, Corey Tuttle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My favorite clarifying shampoo is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Joico's K-PAK Clarifying Shampoo</a>. It's the best at removing product build-up and chlorine, as well as helping rebuild, reconstruct, and repair damaged hair follicles from the inside out, unlike most clarifying shampoos," says celebrity hairstylist,<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2> Paul Norton.</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Clarifying shampoos may be one of the most important tools a stylist can use on their clients prior to a color service or chemical treatment. For me, I have always relied on using Paul Mitchell's Clarifying Shampoos. There is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Paul Mitchell Clarifying Shampoo Two</a>, which helps remove oil and product build-up for the hair and scalp, leaving the hair feeling fresh. This shampoo is also color-safe. They also have Clarifying Shampoo Three, which helps remove chlorine, mineral, and iron build-up. This is great for swimmers," says Honey Artists hairstylist, Tyler Colton.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>HairStory's New Wash</a>. It feels really weird at first because it doesn't lather, but it gently cleanses the hair very effectively, and also doesn't have detergent as an ingredient, so you don't need to use conditioner," says celebrity hairstylist, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Charlie Taylor.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2edlsGktMinnmaxn6q%2Fbr%2FHmqSpp59irq%2BwjJymp5yZqbawusSr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./barry-sanders-sons-wife-parents-html.html><span>←</span><span>Barry Sanders Sons, Wife, Parents, Now</span></a>
