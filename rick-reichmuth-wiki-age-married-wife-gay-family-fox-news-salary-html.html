While browsing his Twitter, we found many fans asking him to reveal his marital status and some wished him luck for his married life.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Well, but after some research, we found something more exciting to satiate the curiosity of his desperate fans. The speculation everybody made about his wedding is correct except the journalist is married for a long time.</p><p>&lt;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187></span><span data-ez-ph-id=187 style="margin-bottom:15px!important;max-width:580px;line-height:0;float:none!important;display:block!important;text-align:center!important;min-height:400px;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;padding:0;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-right:auto!important;margin-left:auto!important;min-width:300px;width:580px"></span><p dir=ltr lang=en>Ha!

We also checked his wife’s profile, but it was private and uninviting to the outsider.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Apart from that, the silence regarding love life and support towards the gay people has made the audience speculate that Rick belongs to the gay orientation.&nbsp;Also, his appearance in the National Lesbian and Gay Journalism Association gala night alongside Shepard Smith and Jamie Colby in 2014 added the suspicion. But after going through this article, you may be clear that he is enjoying a blissful married life and isn’t a gay. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=174 style="float:none!important;margin-top:15px!important;text-align:center!important;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-right:auto!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;line-height:0;padding:0;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;display:block!important;min-height:400px;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-left:auto!important;min-width:580px;max-width:728px;width:728px"></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>His Short Bio:</h2><p style=text-align:justify>&nbsp;According to some wiki sources, Rick Reichmuth was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona to the American family.
