The songs that came from this time in my life were marked by their brutal honesty, unfiltered diaristic confessions and wild wistfulness. I love this album because it tells a tale of growing up, flailing, flying and crashing … and living to speak about it.

Let’s examine.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=is-when-emma-falls-in-love-by-taylor-swift-lyrics-about-emma-stone>Is “When Emma Falls In Love” by Taylor Swift lyrics about Emma Stone?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/emma-stone-taylor-swift.jpg><p>Is “When Emma Falls In Love” by Taylor Swift lyrics about Emma Stone? Fans definitely think so. Taylor Swift and Emma Stone are really close friends and Taylor has the habit of namedropping people she knows in songs (ie.) her best friends Blake Lively and Ryan Reynold’s children Betty and Inez).</p><p>“When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom / Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong,” she sings in the first verse. “She waits and takes her time / ‘Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it’s gonna rain.” This lyric could reference Emma Stone’s performance in Easy A where she sings Natasha Bedingfield’s “Pocket Full of Sunshine.” There’s also a heap load of references to Emma having a good relationship with her mother, which IRL Emma Stone has as well when she would bring her mom to premieres in the early 2010s.</p><p>As one should do with Taylor Swift’s lyrics, fans presented all the evidence for this specific theory. “TAYLOR SWIFT SAID SHE’S THE KIND OF BOOK THAT YOU CAN’T PUT DOWN WHILE ANDREW GARFIELD ONCE SAID I’LL WRITE A BOOK ONE DAY ABOUT HOW I FEEL ABOUT EVERY ASPECT OF EMILY STONE. WHEN EMMA FALLS IN LOVE IS ABOUT STONEFIELD IS ABOUT EMMA STONE,” a Swiftie cried on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Twitter</a>. Another posted that it’s about Emma’s relationship with Succession‘s Kieran Culkin who she dated from 2010-2011.</p><p>In the original album notes, Swift wrote, “”Say it to them. Or say it to yourself in the mirror. Say it in a letter you’ll never send or in a book millions might read someday. I think you deserve to look back on your life without a chorus of resounding voices saying ‘I could’ve, but it’s too late now.'”</p><p>She continued, “There is a time for silence. There is a time waiting your turn. But if you know how you feel, and you so clearly know what you need to say, you’ll know it… I don’t think you should wait. I think you should speak now.”</p><p>Back in the early 2010s, Stone told<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>&nbsp;MTV News</a>&nbsp;that she wrote Swift “an emails aying I liked her music” and their friendship grew from there. “She’s so funny and she’s exactly who you think she is, and I love that,” she shared. When the Eras tour started, the Cruella actress was also in attendance of Swift’s first show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/speak-now-taylors-version-vinyl.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=when-emma-falls-in-love-by-taylor-swift-lyrics>“When Emma Falls In Love” by Taylor Swift Lyrics</h2><p>Here are “When Emma Falls In Love” by Taylor Swift lyrics via<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-when-emma-falls-in-love-taylors-version-from-the-vault-lyrics rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Genius.</a></p><p>[Verse 1]<br>When Emma falls in love, she paces the floor<br>Closes the blinds and locks the door<br>When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom<br>Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong<br>She waits and takes her time<br>‘Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it’s gonna rain<br>When Emma falls in love, I know<br>That boy will never be the same</p><p>[Chorus]<br>‘Cause she’s the kind of book that you can’t put down<br>Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town<br>And all the bad boys would be good boys<br>If they only had a chance to love her<br>And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her</p><p>[Verse 2]<br>When Emma falls in love, it’s all on her face<br>Hangs in the air like stars in outer space<br>When Emma falls in love, she disappears<br>And we all just laugh after seein’ it all these years<br>When Emma falls apart, it’s when she’s alone<br>She takes on the pain and bears it on her own<br>‘Cause when Emma falls in love, she’s in it for keeps<br>She won’t walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave</p><p>[Chorus]<br>And she’s the kind of book that you can’t put down<br>Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town<br>And all the bad boys would be good boys<br>If they only had a chance to love her<br>And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her</p><p>[Bridge]<br>Well, she’s so New York when she’s in L.A.​​<br>She won’t lose herself in love the way that I did<br>‘Cause she’ll call you out, she’ll put you in your place<br>When Emma falls in love, I’m learning</p><p>[Verse 3]<br>Emma met a boy with eyes like a man<br>Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand<br>Now he’ll be her shelter when it rains<br>Little does he know, his whole world’s about to change</p><p>[Chorus]<br>‘Cause she’s the kind of book that you can’t put down<br>Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town<br>And all the bad boys would be good boys<br>If they only had a chance to love her<br>And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her</p><p>[Outro]<br>Yeah, between me and you, sometimes I wish I was her</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
