However, Marianne didn’t resent the musician’s busy schedule. “With Kenny, what you saw is what you got,” she said. “He was very easygoing and had a smile every day.”</p><p>Even after their marriage ended, Marianne made sure Christopher was still a part of his father’s life. “The end of a relationship like that can be devastating, but there were so many fabulous memories. I like to think about those,” the blonde beauty explained. “We had a sweet child together.”</p><p>Christopher remained a part of Kenny’s life until the day the “Coward Of The County” singer took his last breath. When Kenny <a href=#>died</a> at age 81 from natural causes in March 2020, <a href=#>Marianne’s world suddenly collapsed</a>. “It’s very upsetting when I start talking about him,” she said while holding back tears. “He was an incredible person.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/kenny-rogers-wives-guide02.jpg><p>Kenny’s legacy lives on in Christopher and his four other kids — Carole, Kenny Jr. and twins Jordan and Justin — from previous relationships. “I’ve made loads of money and had the biggest and best of everything,” he told Closer in his final interview. “But now I’m back to looking at the small things that matter: my boys. <a href=#><strong>Wanda [Miller]</strong></a>.
