Read more below to find out.</p><h2>What do JISOO’s “FLOWER” lyrics mean?</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>What do Jisoo’s “FLOWER” lyrics mean? In an interview with the Korean site <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">NAVER</a>, JISOO revealed what “Flower” means to her. “I chose ‘FLOWER’ as the title song because it is a song that expresses me the best, with a perfect harmony in all aspects, from vocals to performance to visual elements,” she said via a translation of the article. “From the first time I heard the demo in the studio, something came to me like fate. It’s a dance song, but the lyrics are lyrical, so it has an unexpected charm, and the hook part is very addictive. The affection for ‘All Eyes On Me’ is so special that it was prepared as a candidate for the title song. Feeling cheerful yet deadly? I think a lot of people will like it as much as I do.”</p><p>She conceptualized the [ME] while also looking inside herself for inspiration. “What is the charm of a solo artist ‘Jisoo’?”&nbsp;While preparing for the album, question marks floated around in my head.&nbsp;I wanted to show a new and diverse side of myself while protecting myself.&nbsp;It is an album of ‘me’ itself, created after a lot of trouble to look inside and express it.&nbsp;I participated in the overall part of the album, and I worked with that kind of determination from beginning to end.&nbsp;As I go through the process of discovering new charms that I didn’t know about, I feel myself growing and becoming stronger.”</p><p>JISOO thanked BLINKS for all their support and thought of her fans during the album’s creation. “Every time I hear the modifier ‘first’, my heart flutters and I am amazed.&nbsp;I am grateful that so many fans are cheering for me and looking forward to it, and I feel that I need to work harder.&nbsp;To repay that expectation, I am doing my best until the end.&nbsp;Through the world tour, last year’s finale and this year’s start are with fans, and I’m so happy to release a solo album.&nbsp;It wasn’t prepared with the season in mind, but the timing was perfect as the album was released in the spring when ‘flowers’ bloom.&nbsp;Good start!”</p><h2>JISOO “Flower”
