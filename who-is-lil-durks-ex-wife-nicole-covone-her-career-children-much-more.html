Covone’s ex-husband is also a founding member of the famous Chicago rap group Only The Family. After creating rap songs on social media, Durk established himself in the rap scene with his mixtape Life Ain’t No Joke.</p><p>It’s been a while since people started to notice and take an interest in Lil Durk’s life, professional or otherwise. And when it comes to the romantic side of the rapper, Nicole Covone is a very special name that keeps popping up.</p><p>Nicole Covone is also the mother of Durk’s child. She too was once a loving and promising confidante to him. What went wrong then? Have they really gone their separate ways? And where is Lil Durk’s ex Nicole now? Let’s try to find the answers here.</p><h2><strong>Nicole Covone Relationship With Lil Durk</strong></h2><p>Chicago-born Nicole (born 25 April 1990) started dating Durk, in 2008 when the couple was still teenagers. Three years into their relationship and on 28 November 2011, the high school sweethearts had a son named Angelo. Soon after, they married and on 18 July 2013, they had another child, a daughter Bella.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Nicole-Covone-Relationship-With-Lil-Durk.jpg><p>For a while, the couple did well. Unfortunately for Covone, her artist husband was hiding a destructive secret that would eventually break up their relationship forever.</p><p>Shortly after Nicole gave birth to Bella, the birth of Lil Durk’s <a href=# rel=noopener>third child, Zayden, appeared in the public domain.</a></p><p>To everyone’s surprise, it was revealed that Nikoleta was not Zayden’s mother. Although her husband tried to keep another woman’s name out of the press, he took responsibility for their son and passed on his name. However, Nicole could not survive all the lies and deceit.</p><p>So the young mother decided to divorce just a few months after Bella was born.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who Is Sarah Mathers? Untold Facts About Eminem’s Sister</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Covone Was About To Give Birth To Bella When Durk Was In Court</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>In June 2013, Durk was put behind bars</a> after authorities allegedly found a .40 caliber firearm with a bullet in his possession.</p><p>The then 20-year-old reportedly tried to dispose of the weapon by throwing it into a car.</p><p>In addition to Durk’s family members, 23-year-old Nicole Covone arrived “literally ready to explode”. She was due to give birth to her daughter Bella that day and told the media that Durk was not to blame and that she did not want to give birth to him behind bars. She insisted that he was innocent.</p><h2><strong>Covone’s Online Feud With Her Ex-Husband, Lil Durk</strong></h2><p>Durk is a pretty good dad to all his kids, and fans know he has the means to provide for their daily needs. But Nicolette – and most likely the other children’s mums – don’t always agree that Durk is indeed a good parent to his children.</p><p>In 2016, Durk announced on Instagram that he wanted to take all his children away from their mothers so that he could raise them himself. However, he admitted that his children’s mothers are “perfect and good”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Lil-Durk.jpg><p>To this, Chowan had some harsh words for him, urging Durk to stay away from social media and better act like a father.</p><p>She added that although Durk is a “great father” to their two children, she is not sure what is going on with him at the moment. Covone said that it seems that Durk “wants attention” and that he “needs to talk to his other 10 CHILDREN” when he says he is “taking someone’s children”.</p><p>She emphasized her point by saying that “he knows it won’t fly” and suggested that Durk “stop the nonsense”.</p><h2><strong>Who Is Covone’s Ex-Husband Dating Now?</strong></h2><p>The Chicago-born rapper is currently dating India Royale. The duo welcomed a baby daughter, Willow, in October 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Lil-Durk-And-India-Royale.jpg><p>Durk began a relationship with Royale in 2017. In September 2018, he asked her to marry him. In addition to Angelo, Bella, Zayden, and Willow, Durk has two more children, Du’mier and Skyler, both born in 2014.</p><p>Lils has not yet revealed the name of Du’mier and Skyler’s mother.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>What’s Jaycee Dugard’s Daughter Starlet Dugard Doing Now? The True Story</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Has Nicole Covone Moved On Too?</strong></h2><p>At the moment, Covone seems to be quite busy being a mum to her two children with her ex-husband Lil Durk. On her Facebook account, she has defined herself as single.</p><p>Strangely, Covone has not yet deleted her Facebook pictures with Durk, although the dust has completely settled.</p><p>While Durk has repeatedly confirmed his relationship with Royale through his Insta, Covone has not yet revealed her new love affair. In fact, it’s unclear if she’s looking for a new partner at all.</p><h2><strong>Where Is Nicole Covone Now?</strong></h2><p>The 31-year-old currently lives with her two children in Chicago, Illinois. And as far as her professional aspirations are concerned, the mixed-ethnic Nicole has not yet revealed what she will be doing in 2022.</p><h2><strong>Quick Facts About Nicole Covone</strong></h2><table class="table table-striped facts"><tbody><tr><th>Full Name:</th><td>Nicole Covone</td></tr><tr><th>Born Date:</th><td>25 Apr 1990</td></tr><tr><th>Age:</th><td>32 years</td></tr><tr><th>Horoscope:</th><td>Taurus</td></tr><tr><th>Lucky Number:</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Lucky Stone:</th><td>Emerald</td></tr><tr><th>Lucky Color:</th><td>Green</td></tr><tr><th>Best Match for Marriage:</th><td>Virgo, Cancer, Capricorn</td></tr><tr><th>Gender:</th><td>Female</td></tr><tr><th>Country:</th><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><th>Marital Status:</th><td>single</td></tr><tr><th>Divorce</th><td>Lil Durk</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth</th><td>$800,000</td></tr><tr><th>Eye Color</th><td>Dark brown</td></tr><tr><th>Hair Color</th><td>Dark brown</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Place</th><td>Chicago, Illinois,</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th>Ethnicity</th><td>Italian-American</td></tr><tr><th>Mother</th><td>Diana Covone</td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kxKm7jKKqZqSZoXqlwdGkqmadqGLEqrLEZqWim5%2Bhsm6vzq%2Bmp51dnbKzecKaqZ6domKwqbXLnamepl2iwqS0jKamq51f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./enhypen-review.html><span>←</span><span>New York City K-Pop Stuns Radio City Music Hall</span></a>
