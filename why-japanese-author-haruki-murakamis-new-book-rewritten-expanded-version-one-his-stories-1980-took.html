The availability of an English translation is not yet known. It is his first novel since the 2017 bestseller Killing Commendatore.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Murakami wasn’t in Japan when the book was released. He has been holding seminars about female protagonists in his stories at Wellesley College, the tertiary educational institution for women in the US state of Massachusetts once attended by former US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and late Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Initially, Murakami’s intention was to rewrite the 1980 story The City, and Its Uncertain Walls, published in the Bungakukai literary magazine, to improve it. But the story didn’t end there, and Murakami kept writing. The old version was rewritten, then became the first chapter of what turned into a three-part, 672-page novel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Part 2, the protagonist gets a job as head of a library in a small town in Fukushima, Japan, where he meets his mysterious predecessor and a teenage boy as the story leads up to the final section.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/13/a644a0b2-4bf6-4175-b2cc-f01214621dea_5d38dfdf.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Going to the other side of the wall requires determination, belief and physical strength, Murakami says. “You have to squeeze out all your might, or you can’t go to the other side of the world.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His stories are “by no means pessimistic”, he says. “Despite many bizarre things and a dark side, my stories are fundamentally positive. I think stories must be positive.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In some of his earlier stories, protagonists travel between two worlds, through a wall, a well or a cave.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think that sliding through a wall, a process that involves going to the other side of the world and coming back from there, is an extremely important step,” Murakami says.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I really enjoy writing. It’s fun to write, and rewriting is more funHaruki Murakami</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are many kinds of walls, he explains – between conscious and unconscious, real and unreal, and the physical walls that separate societies, such as what used to stand in Berlin and the barriers between Israel and the Palestinian territories.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He kept thinking about the meaning of the wall in this story while writing it, he says. Walls can carry different meanings and purpose, depending on who are inside, he adds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Equally important to Murakami and his stories is the shadow. He says the shadow is a form of his subconscious, or an alter ego, which resembles his negative side and helps him to know himself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/13/a8d4dbdf-ae35-40d7-9506-8686a17e764a_5d38dfdf.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Writing a novel, for me, is to dig down to that depth,” he says. The distinction between the main body and the shadow became blurry in the book, which broadened the story’s scope. Murakami said it was a difficult process and he had to rewrite it many times.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m now in my mid-70s, and I don’t know how many more novels I can write. So I strongly felt that I must write this story with affection, and spend ample time to do so,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Murakami, whose first published story was Hear the Wind Sing in 1979, says the original version of his new novel contained the key elements of the wall and the shadow, but it also had potential that was too complex for a second-year novelist to handle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/13/e9a08408-2c6b-4043-bbbb-19b2824c657d_5d38dfdf.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It then evolved as part of Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, a 1985 bestseller of two intertwined stories of pop and action-filled science fiction and an imaginary world of a secluded, walled city of the dead.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Looking back, Murakami says even that attempt was premature. He shelved a rewriting attempt for another 35 years, though the story stayed on his mind, “like a tiny fishbone stuck in the throat”, he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Murakami says he started feeling confident about his storytelling ability mid-career, around 2000, just before he wrote Kafka on the Shore, the bestselling novel released in 2002.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy changed this educator’s life</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At age 74, Murakami says he is now more intrigued by the tranquillity in “the End of the World” part of the 1985 novel than the pop and action depicted in the “Hard-Boiled Wonderland” side of that novel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You can’t help it, and I think it’s only natural,” he says, but he never tires of balancing writing novels, translating his favourite Western literature and, in recent years, hosting his own radio show.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I really enjoy writing. It’s fun to write, and rewriting is more fun.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The driving force for his multiformat operation, he says, is running. It’s his daily morning routine and he has run 40 marathons.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Translation, running and collecting used records,” he says, citing his hobbies. “I don’t have time for a night life, which might have been a good thing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmmq6kpKq%2FpnvAq6uim5yafHR%2BkG9wcGtfrLW6ecmap5qmlaiybq3UrZ%2Boql2drrPByqJkpq2ilriiucisZKedp2KvsLvKZqmer6KewbWxzWacsaiRo7GmsIyvnKurmaS7brvNnmShoaNiwLW70aKcrGVhboVxedOopqQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./509992-whose-wedding-invitation-complete-guide.html><span>←</span><span>Whose name goes first on a wedding invitation?
