I go on a lot of road trips up and down the coast, where I'm living out of the car and all I've packed is a backpack of clothes. So, that allows me to keep my style really simple and flexible—bringing just a pair of pants, a pair of shorts, a couple shirts and a jacket. I also skateboard a lot so that may be why I'm such a tomboy. You'll mostly see me kicking around in something super relaxed. <strong>Your style icons, one living, one dead?</strong> Jane Birkin and Nico from the Velvet Underground</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Look 1: Beach to Cocktails</h2><img alt="this image is not available" data-cy=slide-image-3 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span><p><strong>What's your go-­to outfit on any given weekday?</strong> Jeans, a baby tee, and Converse <strong>Currently listening to?</strong> Reverberation Radio (best music blog) <strong>Currently reading?</strong> Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><h2 class="css-d0386z eutn2uj7">Look 2: A Night Out</h2><img alt="this image is not available" data-cy=slide-image-4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span><p>"I am wearing a vintage <strong>Content Los Angeles </strong>brown dress with my flat leather sandals by <strong>Cornetti </strong>.

I would never intentionally wear the same exact outfit out two nights in a row....but then again, I don't think I'd care if I got caught. I wear whatever I want when I feel like it, as long as I feel good in it. <strong>Are you an editor or builder—Do you clean out your closets at the end of each season? How often do you purge your wardrobe?</strong> I would call myself a collector. I go vintage shopping a lot, whether it's at my local flea market or eBay. I often get tired of things and will clean out my closet as soon as it starts to overflow. Usually cleaning out my closet means putting everything in a box and into storage until I go through it again and decide I can't actually give it up. I am building an etsy store though, that should help.
