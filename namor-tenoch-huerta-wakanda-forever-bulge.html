But was his crotch digitally altered in the final cut of the film?
That's a theory that started going around the internet after one fan posted a shot of Huerta from the first trailer released at Comic-Con, compared to a grab seemingly from the movie as it appeared in theaters."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Without [the bulge]! That's original," he told the outlet. "No, I mean, I'm not going to lie to people. Every man in the world, we have fragile masculinity, but not in that issue. I will say, the right one, the real one is the photo on the right."</p><p>So there you have it.</p><p><strong>WARNING: "Wakanda Forever" spoilers to follow!</strong></p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5a22b2a8-2094-48b8-8aa9-4bf7da52e382 data-container-ref=toofab:article:8d1fb4f5-42af-4c5f-a693-04a8d2d3bef9 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f5/5by4/2022/11/07/f557b39e4ebd461eb1c242af05e39705_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Marvel</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">6 Burning Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Questions Answered (Spoilers)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The actor was also asked how it feels to step into a role where he knows he'll have to stay in fantastic shape for as long as he'll play the character. As Namor is still very much alive by the end of the film and will clearly play a big role in the future of the MCU, he'll be rocking those short shorts ... and not much else ... for years to come.</p><p>"Concerned! I actually worry about it. No, it’s a big problem, man," he told Rolling Stone. "I can't cut off my amount of tacos from now on. But, yeah, it's funny. I don't know."</p><p>"It's something that my trainer told me. 'Okay, man, now you can rest, you can chill and take your time. But not too much, because if you have to play Namor one more time, you need to go through the same process all over again. So it's better you take care of yourself and don't get crazy with tacos,'" he added.</p><p>"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever" is in theaters now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGpma2pfo66uu9Fmq56mn5i1brTUnqmtmV2srqytzZ2YZp6fp7K3sdFmma6kl5p8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miranda-cosgrove-drake-bell-brian-peck.html><span>←</span><span>Miranda Cosgrove Responds to Drake Bell, Brian Peck Sexual Abuse Case</span></a>
