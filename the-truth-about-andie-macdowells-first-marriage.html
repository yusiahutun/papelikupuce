And, from the outside, Andie MacDowell and Paul Qualley's life seemed truly idyllic. The former couple lived on a sprawling 457-acre ranch in Montana, where they spent their time renovating the house, building a barn, and raising their children (per <a href=#>Mansion Global</a>). While this might sound like a rustic fantasy come to life, "The Four Weddings and a Funeral" actor eventually grew impatient with rural living.</p><p dir=ltr>Speaking to <a href=#>The Age</a> in 2002, she admitted that she "didn't want to grow older in the middle of nowhere among people who weren't my family." She also expressed frustration at the perception of Qualley as a perfect "Mr. Mom" house husband, pointing out that they had nannies to help with childcare.</p><p dir=ltr>The family moved to South Carolina to be close to MacDowell's sister in 1998, but it did not save the marriage, with the pair divorcing one year later. Although the "Groundhog Day" actor didn't go into detail about why they split, simply stating it was "for the usual reasons," it seems that they faced some significant incompatibilities. Their daughter, "Maid" actor <a href=#>Margaret Qualley</a>, described them as being very different, telling Metro (via <a href=#>Ladyfirst</a>) that her father's house "had no TV, no computers, no wi-fi, no microwaves," while her mother preferred a more modern approach to life and technology.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2pobYJ0e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2Wu6W1xGakmpuUpMSmuMusZJ%2BhoqjBbrnAq6mimZeafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-true-meaning-behind-things-a-man-oughta-know-by-lainey-wilson.html><span>←</span><span>The True Meaning Behind 'Things A Man Oughta Know' By Lainey Wilson</span></a>
