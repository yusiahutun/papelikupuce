Since their first red carpet appearance, it has been obvious this duo is in fashion harmony. Both Momoa and Bonet seem to enjoy scarves and jewelry, have a thing for leather jackets, and give off a relaxed, chill, eccentric sort of vibe — in the coolest and best way possible.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They also didn't shy away from matching with Momoa's favorite rose-colored hue. "Pink is just a beautiful color," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle</a>. "And I'm pretty secure in my masculinity.
