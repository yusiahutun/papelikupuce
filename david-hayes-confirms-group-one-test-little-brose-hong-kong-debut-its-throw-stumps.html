It will be a very unusual situation.</p><p>“If he runs fourth in the big race, his next start he’ll be in a Class Three off 77 and he’s a 106 international-rated horse.</p><p>“The lovely thing about the Jockey Club now, they give these young, Group horses a chance off the handicap. In the old days, he would have come in as a 98 [rater].</p><p>“I don’t care if he goes up 50 points if he wins the Group One because he’s a stallion prospect. But if he runs a good race, he’s still protected in the handicap, which is great. He gets a maximum of five [points] for running a place.”</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/15/0f596bd1-cfd6-4298-846c-5e8b8846fd79_7c0d28ad.jpg data-fid=14938523 data-resolution=1 width=2000 height=1426 title="Little Brose with Hugh Bowman on board before a Sha Tin trial last month." alt="Little Brose with Hugh Bowman on board before a Sha Tin trial last month." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Hayes will get an insight into his game plan for the HK$22 million Chairman’s Sprint Prize when Little Brose trials again at Happy Valley on Friday.</p><p>“He’ll have a trial in blinkers on Friday and that will decide whether I run him in blinkers or not,” he said.</p><p>“My mail from very good informants – my sons – is that he’s a very lazy worker and trialler, and he races much better than he works. I think his trials have been pretty good for a lazy worker.”</p><p>Before Friday’s crucial trial, Hayes will bid to continue his top form with a team of five runners at Happy Valley on Wednesday night, headlined by Samarkand and Strongest Boy.</p><p>Samarkand has had a breakout season in Hong Kong with four victories and will chase a hat-trick in the Class Three Magazine Gap Handicap (1,650m).</p><p>The son of Mongolian Khan has thrived at the city circuit, notching all four wins this term there.</p><p>“Really, really happy with him,” said Hayes, who is three wins shy of reaching 600 in Hong Kong.</p><p>“I was up at Conghua and his trackwork shows he hasn’t gone backwards. He loves the Valley and he gives himself the run of the race. You win a lot of races if you do that, you go a lot higher than your ability.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/15/ce43a688-d1b8-4c3d-8289-f8f1fc3a7ccf_dd9681bc.jpg data-fid=14938524 data-resolution=1 width=2000 height=1383 title="Samarkand gallops on the all-weather track at Sha Tin on April 15." alt="Samarkand gallops on the all-weather track at Sha Tin on April 15." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“I’ve only had him this season, but I think he’s like many horses who take time to adjust to Hong Kong and he’s really acclimatised.”</p><p>Jerry Chau Chun-lok will again ride Samarkand, who must overcome the outside draw in the field of 12.</p><p>Strongest Boy heads into the Class Four Mount Cameron Handicap (1,650m) in top form with a win and two placings from his past three starts.</p><p>“He’ll be one of the favourites,” Hayes said. “He’s absolutely thriving in Conghua and he’s always hard to beat in this class.”</p><p>Zac Purton will ride Strongest Boy, who has drawn barrier eight.</p><p>Comments</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mq5mTnruoe8Crq6KbnJp8dH6Ucmdpa1%2BZrre1w2afmrGVqHqku82foKulo2K0s7vUqWSoppViwaa%2F02ajoqykobJurtGoqp5lmKS7qHnKqKWgZZSar7bAjKKrrGWknb%2Bww4ysq66loKg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./516245-6-month-anniversary-quotes-captions-messages.html><span>←</span><span>100+ best 6-month anniversary quotes, captions, and messages</span></a>
