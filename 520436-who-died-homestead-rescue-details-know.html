Since its debut in 2016, the show has garnered a dedicated fan base owing to its distinctive storyline and the Raney family's proficiency in off-the-grid living.</p><h2 id=520436-what-happened-in-homestead-rescue class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>What happened in Homestead Rescue?</h2><p class=align-left>A major change happened in the <a href=#>reality TV show</a> when Marty Raney, the main star and leader of the Raney family, decided to leave.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d891ae17e6649bee.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nelly Confirms He's Back Together with Ashanti 10 Years after Breakup: "It Wasn't Planned"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Marty knew a lot about homesteading and was very practical. People liked his personality, but unexpectedly, he left the show after the sixth season. This made fans feel sad and worried about what would happen to the show.</p><p class=align-left>The show's producers had a tough job because they had to keep it going without Marty. So, they brought in someone new to join the cast. This was Matt Raney, Marty's son, who had been featured on the show several times before.</p><p class=align-left>However, not everyone had the same reaction to this change. Some were happy about it, while others remained loyal to Marty Raney.</p><h2 id=520436-did-marty-raney-die class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Did Marty Raney Die?</h2><p class=align-left>Marty Raney has always been heavy on privacy, and after his exit from <i>Homestead Rescue</i>, he hasn’t been heard or seen on screen. This has made most of his fans think he might be dead, hence the question, "Did Marty Raney Die?” No, Marty Raney, born on 28th July 1956, is still alive. He lives a healthy and happy life with his family.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a6210661ebdb5d87.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Quincy Timberlake's Son Joins Aeronautical College after Kind Kenyans Raised Over KSh 500k</span></p></a><h2 id=520436-did-the-raineys-rebuild-after-the-fire class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Did the Raineys rebuild after the fire?</h2><p class=align-left>Raney's cabin was razed down by fire in season 2, episode 5.

The one lesson this episode had for the fans is how to persevere in the face of adversity.</p><p class=align-left>However, the fire incident raised a lot of questions amongst fans. Some felt that <i>Homestead Rescue</i> made a big deal out of it and that it was just staged to promote the reality show. In addition, there wasn’t much footage of Rainey’s cabin being engulfed in flames on camera or context on the incident.</p><h2 id=520436-homestead-rescue-death-episode class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Homestead Rescue death episode</h2><p class=align-left>In Season 2, Episode 12 of <i>Homestead Rescue</i>, titled Hill of Death, the Raney family had a challenging mission.
