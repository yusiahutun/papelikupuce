I’d love to say it was skateboarding or something really kind of cool, but I think I think it’s something that’s important to share because I think it’s literally, probably after heart disease, one of the biggest killers in America, which is stress,” she confessed. “Stress sheared off my front teeth. But, in an effort to get ready for you, I wanted to make sure my teeth were in.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/demi-moore-teeth.jpg><p>Demi added that she “literally knocked her tooth out” recently. “It was almost like it fell out and my warranty was up.
