He married his wife and high school sweetheart, Toni, in 1974. They share two daughters, Angie and Jenny, and two granddaughters, Charlee and Payton. (Gerry’s daughters were the ones who encouraged him to apply for The Golden Bachelor.) Gerry and Toni were married for 43 years until her death from an illness in 2017, six weeks after her retirement. “She got robbed,” Gerry told Good Morning America about Toni. “Every day that goes by, that’s the thought I have.”</p><p>When asked what Toni would think of him starring on The Golden Bachelor, Gerry told Good Morning America that he believed his late wife would be “rooting” for him. “I have her picture on a dresser in my closet,” he said. “Every morning I give her the nod, ‘So what do you think about this?’ For a while it was like I was having a hard time figuring out if she would be OK. But we always told each other, when one of us goes, we want the other one to be happy.” He continued, “She’s saying, ‘Yeah Gerry, do this.’”</p><p>As for what he’s looking for, Gerry told Good Morning America that he wants a partner who matches his personality and loves sports. “I’d love it if I found a partner who was high energy, someone who’s fairly competitive, that they enjoy sports,” he said. “Someone that maybe plays pickleball, someone that maybe plays golf.”</p><p>Read Gerry’s Golden Bachelor biography ahead.</p><p>“It’s never too late to find love, and Gerry Turner is ready to prove it! ABC announced today that the charming 71-year-old patriarch from Indiana is the network’s first Golden Bachelor, showcasing that love stories, like so many other things, only get better with age.

He’s often busy hosting barbecues, playing pickleball, cheering on his favorite Chicago sports teams, four-wheeling and spending time with friends and family at restaurants and local haunts.</p><p>Always a romantic, Turner married his high school sweetheart, Toni, in 1974. Together, they lived a full and happy life with their two daughters, Angie and Jenny, and later two granddaughters, Charlee and Payton. Sadly, after 43 years together, Toni suddenly fell ill and passed away in 2017.</p><p>Six years after Toni’s passing and with the support of his family, Turner is ready to put himself out there and find a love that will stand the test of time in his golden years.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-theresa-nist-from-the-golden-bachelor></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfnLKzvthmq6GdoprAonnRnpqeqKSevK97</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./channing-tatum-height.html><span>←</span><span>Channing Tatum Height, Weight, Age, Relationship, Biowiki &amp;amp; Body Statistics</span></a>
