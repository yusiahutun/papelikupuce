Arrested After Airport Incident, What Did She Do?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Victoria Ramirez from Florida has been mentioned as the woman who got arrested at the Aiport. The name circulating has instilled numerous questions among the netizens.</p><p>The latest news on the Florida airport was a month ago when a passenger landed the plane thereafter the pilot becomes clueless. Similarly, the name Victoria Ramirez was popular in 2018 when she was found guilty of trying to kill her husband.</p><p>While the Internet tries to connect the existing dots, let’s get into the depth of the two cases and try to find out the reason behind her recent limelight.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-victoria-ramirez-from-florida></span>Who Is Victoria Ramirez From Florida?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Victoria Ramirez from Florida has reported being arrested at the airport. The buzz going on around the name is quite strong but the exact details are yet to be revealed by the authorities.</p><p>When we trace this name, we go to 2018, when a 20-year-old woman with the same name got arrested for four counts of attempted murder. She was found guilty by another woman.</p><p>According to the DA’s office, Vasquez’s “off-and-on” contact with a guy who lived with his mother and grandmother in a house on Hilby Avenue was the catalyst for everything.</p><p>Vasquez started a habit of arriving at the residence in the middle of the night, yelling at the boyfriend’s mother and grandmother, causing property vandalism, and threatening the family during an “off” period in the relationship in December 2015.</p><p>In April 2016, the grandmother, a frail old woman confined to a wheelchair, requested a restraining order, but Vasquez’s behavior worsened, according to the district attorney’s office. Vasquez returned to the residence without permission in April 2017 and threatened to set it on fire.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=victoria-ramirez-arrested-after-an-airport-incident></span>Victoria Ramirez Arrested After An Airport Incident<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When suddenly the name Victoria Ramirez is trending all over, it has been said that she is someone who got arrested over an airport incident. However, there have been no details on what wrong she actually committed.</p><p>The latest news surrounding the Florida airport dates back to May 2022. Following an altercation with the captain, a passenger made a landing at Palm Beach International Airport on Tuesday. The passenger of the single-engine Cessna 208 phoned air traffic control after the pilot “became incoherent,” according to a report from WPBF in West Palm Beach.</p><p>The passenger admitted to the traffic controller that they didn’t know how to fly a plane or even where they were other than off the coast of Florida.</p><p>WPBF report said that the air traffic controller at the Fort Pierce tower assisted the passenger in bringing the aircraft down to 5,000 feet so that they could identify it on the radar. The air traffic controller then instructed the passenger on how to operate the aircraft and land it safely.</p><p>One passenger was brought to a local hospital after the plane touched down, although it was unclear what condition they were in. There were just two passengers. The FAA was looking into it and the further development of the case was never reported.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yvoJysn6e2onnRmqSiqpWveqe%2BzqZkn6Sfp7alrYyaqaudo6mypXnAn6ueql2WtrO8zqurZqGemLalsc2tZLCgkal6pbXDZqqhnV2ZvG5%2BjmVjZWRcYXk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-callum-turner-8612466.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Callum Turner?</span></a>
