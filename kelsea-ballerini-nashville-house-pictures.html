She worked with interior designer Lindsay Rhodes on the house, which she's finally showing off to fans in a new cover story for the Spruce.</p><p>The country-pop singer-songwriter says she was happy with life in her previous condo in downtown Nashville until the pandemic changed her mind.</p><p>“I have a dog, and I grew up on a big piece of land,” she says in the Spruce's cover story. “I realized that I needed to connect with that part of myself again. It’s a small lot; it’s half an acre, but it’s just enough for this chapter of life.”</p><p>Ballerini says the transition gave her the opportunity to create a more mature feel in her new home, but she still has a taste for bold, striking visual elements.</p><p>“I’m a maximalist and I love wallpaper,” she explains, and the pictures below certainly bear that out.</p><p>Her sunroom boasts a bright pattern everywhere, including the ceiling, and her home office also offers some eye-catching wallpaper. Other areas of the home, including the kitchen, are more restrained.</p><p>Ballerini is living on her own these days after recently announcing that she's <a href=#>going through a divorce</a> from her husband of nearly five years, Morgan Evans. She's set to release a new album, Subject to Change, on Friday (Sept. 23). She'll also embark on a tour in support of the album; Ballerini's Heartfirst Tour&nbsp;begins on Sept. 24 at Radio City Music Hall and continues through Oct. 14 in Mashantucket, Ct., with stops in Denver, L.A., Atlanta and Boston along the way.</p><p>Scroll through the photos below to see inside Kelsea Ballerini's deluxe Nashville farmhouse, and visit <a href=#>TheSpruce.com</a> to see more pictures, videos and to read Ballerini's in-depth interview.</p><p>The Spruce's digital issue featuring cover star Kelsea Ballerini is <a href=#>available now</a>.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Kelsea Ballerini's Dazzling Nashville Farmhouse</h2><p>Kelsea Ballerini is taking fans inside the dazzling modern farmhouse that she now calls home in Nashville.
