Convex side up. That means that when you hold a single chip, it should look like like an upside-down smile; the ends should be pointed down, and the center should rise up. Essentially, when you place it on the table, it shouldn’t be able to stand by itself. If that still doesn’t make sense, it’s the bottom chip when you make your Pringles into duck lips.</p><p>Why should you eat it convex side up? Well, a Pringles spokesman told the British tabloid The Sun Online that only one side of the chip is seasoned.</p><p>“Many people think that Pringles are seasoned on both sides,” but “in fact, only the top side gets a sprinkling of seasoning in the factory. When Pringles are stacked in their can, some of the seasoning rubs off onto the next chip—which is why they’ve always been a little uneven.”</p><p>MUST-SEE: <a href=#>6 Weight-Loss Snacks You Should Be Eating</a></p><p>So if you want the most flavor in one bit, start with the convex side up. However, if you prefer something less intense, flip over the chip and enjoy. That said, you’re completely free to enjoy your chips any way you please—whether that convex side up, concave side up, or totally at random.</p><p>Now, all this talk of chips has got us <a href=#>craving something salty</a>!</p><p>via <a href=#>DailyMail.co.uk</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More from Woman’s World</h2><p><a href=#>Easy Way to Serve Chips & Dip</a></p><p><a href=#>6 Weight-Loss Snacks to Eat Before Bed</a></p><p><a href=#>Get Rid of Belly Fat with 7 Simple Changes</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonainlGK%2Fpq%2FIqZysZ6SdtrR5yKxkraCVYrCwvtGemq1lp5bGbsDOZpyarF2lv6q6xqWcrGVhaH10gpU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./karri-turner.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Karri Turner dating?
