It would be foolish to make it all the way to Las Vegas—Jon is here, Luda’s her—and not play ‘Yeah!’”</p><p>TMZ also reported that Alicia Keys will be joining Usher on stage <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.tmz.com/2024/02/09/alicia-keys-confirmed-usher-super-bowl-lviii-halftime-show/?adid=social-tw">to perform their hit</a> “My Boo” together. Eyewitnesses told the site that they were seen at rehearsals performing the song together.</p><p>The music legend teased what we can expect in an interview with Good Morning America&nbsp;on February 2.</p><p>“I think about what our country has kind of represented for Black artists, you know, having to at some point go through kitchens to even be able to perform for an audience, but they had to leave back through that same door, fear for their lives as they went to the next state to do the same thing,” he said. “So I’m coming through the front door with this one.”</p><p>He continued: “I didn’t start where I am now, and I didn’t get there by myself. So, everybody that has been a part of it, I’m carrying them with me. All of my fans, my loved ones, the people who may have felt like they have been forgotten, they haven’t. I’m carrying you right with me when I walk on that stage that night.”</p><p>In another interview, Usher stayed mum on who would be joining him on stage. “Well, one thing I can say is I’ve, you know, collaborated with a lot of incredible artists throughout the years,” he told<a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_aQ5T-bm-g"> Apple Music’s Zane Lowe.</a> “If anything, I like the socially engaged the world, you know what I’m saying? I like to hear who you think, you know, would be a great guest, great guest to complement this.”&nbsp;</p><p>Lowe deflected the question and Usher replied, “There’ll be many more Sundays to talk about this leading up to the Grand Sunday of all. Yeah. And I’m so happy that we were able to, you know, launch it today.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfqsCpsdFmqq6olad6o7vWpWSgrZWowbR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-star-wars-gifts.html><span>←</span><span>Star Wars Day 2024: 9 best Star Wars gifts to surprise film fans with on May 4</span></a>
