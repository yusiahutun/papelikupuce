Lower Investment Threshold & Priority Processing</h3><p>The minimum threshold for an EB-5 immigrant investor visa starts at $1,050,000, which can be through a regional center, or directly into a business that creates at least 10 permanent jobs for American workers.&nbsp;</p><p>However, if invested in a Targeted Employment Area, the <a href=# rel=noopener>minimum investment is significantly lower</a>, starting at $800,000, and investors also benefit from priority processing, with 32% of visas set aside for TEA investments.&nbsp;</p><p>Within this 32% reservation for TEA investments, 10% is aimed at high-unemployment TEAs, 2% for public infrastructure, and a mammoth 20% for rural TEAs. Historically, the first two tend to fill-up fairly quickly, on a first-come, first-serve basis, resulting in long wait times.</p><p>However, by investing in rural projects, investors can effectively cut in line, and receive their Green Cards much earlier than others.</p><p>This provision also represents a<a href=#> life-line for investors from countries</a> with high demand for visas, resulting in a retrogression.</p><p>This essentially means that for immigrant investors from certain nationalities such as China, Taiwan, and India, the cut-off dates for availability moves backward instead of forward, and investments in rural TEAs are a great way to stand-out, and receive priority processing.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Better Risk-To-Reward Ratio</h3><p>Rural TEAs are regions with no more than 20,000 residents, currently having an unemployment rate of more than 150% the national average.</p><p>Investments in such regions, in general, go against the norms of prudent investing, however, given the low thresholds, and lower valuations, the rate of return can be higher as the region starts to develop, as against already saturated urban investments.</p><p>Of course, this depends on the viability of the project, capital structure, and over project management, and investors should perform a thorough research before settling on any project.</p><p>Most regional center projects tend to have low, or even no-returns on investment, from about 0.5% to 2%, which are just a little over CDs, but with the right due-diligence, returns in excess of 5% to 6% aren’t that rare.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Plenty of Opportunities</h3><p>Another significant upside of investing in rural TEAs is that the number of opportunities are substantially higher.</p><p>There are a number of decaying backwaters in the American mainland that have suffered from out-migration and urbanization in recent years, looking for fresh lease of life in the form of new investments, this suits perfectly with most EB-5 investor objectives.</p><p>Up until a few decades ago, the United States was a nation of small towns, and even today there are over 17,000 towns, cities, and villages with a population of less than 20,000.</p><p>Out of these there are quite a few regions with unemployment rates in excess of the national average, giving investors plenty of opportunities to add value, and capture substantial gains as these regions develop.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Final Verdict</h2><p>With nearly 80,000 investors applying for the EB-5 program each year, and competing for just 10,000 Green Cards, investing in rural TEAs remains the only way to get ahead of the herd.&nbsp;</p><p>This is especially true if investors come from the four leading countries – China, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. All in all, rural projects are the future of the renewed EB-5 program, and it remains to be seen the kind of innovative projects that developers can come up with to cater to this demand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZMGpsYyfrK2topp6sLKMnplmbV2lv7Cz0ZqkrA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-marianne-gordons-net-worth-kenny-rogers-ex-is-doing-well.html><span>←</span><span>Kenny Rogers Ex-Wife Marianne Gordons Impressive Net Worth Proves She Has Her Own Money</span></a>
