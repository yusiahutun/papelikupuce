I love swimming, when I got into the water naked I loved it. That sold it for me…</p><p>"My husband and I don't work anymore and we live pretty much naked unless it's really cold.</p><p>"Just normal activities but you don't put clothes on. It is very freeing. People tend to make assumptions or judgements, based on what you're wearing. It's a great leveller.</p><p>"There is no class, no status or distinctions, you don't feel as if you're being judged. It is very body positive.</p><p>"Everyone is the same fundamentally under there, even though we might be unique."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article23239230.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_JS218761857.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>So will you be joining the movement? If so, you should probably learn about the etiquette of nudism first.</p><p>Donna has compiled a list of dos and don’ts of living life in the buff – and you can check them out below.</p><h3>Be comfortable in your own skin</h3><p>Donna advises that people take it slowly and build their confidence up if they're concerned about getting naked in public.</p><p>She said: "You have to be comfortable in your own skin, and feel as if it's a normal way of being.</p><p>"Get used to being naked indoors and then naked in your garden. Most people can't just suddenly go to a naked beach and strip off.</p><p>"Do it slowly and gradually."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24312082.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_Nudismjpeg.jpg><h3>Go to a designated beach</h3><p>The law on being naked on British beaches is a bit of a grey area.</p><p>It is technically okay to drop trouser and wade into the sea on any patch of coast, so long as you don't 'harass, alarm or distress others'.</p><p>Donna recommends heading to one of the country's many specialist nudist beaches to avoid any opportunities to startle members of the public.</p><p>"If you're new to it, I suggest a designated beach," she said.</p><p>"You won't stand out too much."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24312085.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_Nudism_05jpeg.jpg><h3>Be respectful to others</h3><p>Donna says there are no strict rules about when it's okay or not okay to amble up to a naked stranger and spark up a chat.</p><p>Instead she recommends reading the room and treating people, particularly women, with respect.</p><p>"Naked females on the beach are unusual," she continued.</p><p>"Naturism only has a 30% balance of women, so a naked female on the beach is like 'oh my god it's a female'.</p><p>"But a lot of the naturist guys like to have mixed company. It is quite nice to talk to a woman for a change.”</p><a href=# data-link-tracking=inArticle|photoStory><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24312086.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_Nudism_02jpeg.jpg></a><p><a href=# data-link-tracking=inArticle|photoStory>Nudists celebrate Naked in Nature Day by stripping off in the great outdoors</a></p><a class="embed-placeholder-link publication-theme" href=# data-link-tracking=inArticle|photoStory>View gallery<span></span></a><p>Donna continued: "You can't say to people 'don't approach women', the woman could then feel 'what's wrong with me'.</p><p>"Treat people with respect. If she's making eye contact say good morning but carry on walking."</p><h3>Have fun and take your clothes off</h3><p>Above all, Donna recommends first-timers enjoy themselves.</p><p>She said: "It's all about respect for yourself. There should be nothing different with how you are when you have clothes on.</p><p>"Relax, enjoy it and take your clothes off. You will feel more comfortable."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKqVlrluuMifnGimpZm2tMCMrJ%2BaqpWoeqW70mabqKakqHq0wNGip6mhnpx6c4CRcmdwb2A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./country-star-miranda-lambert-stuns-fans-figure-in-celebratory-new-video.html><span>←</span><span>Miranda Lambert is the ultimate cowgirl in her latest outfit - and we're obsessed</span></a>
