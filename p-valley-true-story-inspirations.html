The playwright also spoke to dozens of dancers and visited many strip clubs to do justice to a community that has often been dehumanized in media. Read on to learn more about the inspirations behind the show.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Creator Katori Hall wanted to show the lives of exotic dancers in their "full humanity."</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hall told the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/arts/television/p-valley-katori-hall.html?utm_source=pocket_mylist" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="New York Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">New York Times</a> that she grew up going to strip clubs during her youth, and later tried pole dancing classes, which helped her see the athleticism and hustle involved in stripping.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"You know, strip clubs were actually a little bit mundane to me. Going to strip clubs was just a regular thing that I did on the weekends growing up," she said. "I celebrated birthdays there. I went to a baby shower in a strip club once. I did a lot of coming-of-age things at strip clubs. It was just part of the social fabric of being a Black girl growing up in the American South."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The director and writer also told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.essence.com/entertainment/only-essence/ode-to-wendy-williams/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Essence class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Essence</a> that she thinks of the show as a "humanization project," where viewers can feel empathy towards these characters who belong to marginalized communities.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I want people to look at Uncle Clifford, Mercedes, Autumn Night, Miss Mississippi and see themselves," she said. "For me, it’s about making these unreal characters create a bridge of empathy and understanding for women who haven’t had that opportunity to be seen as the full body beings that they are."</p><img alt="pvalley true story inspirations" title="p-valley true story inspirations" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/puv2-202-080421-0044-a-1655673886.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Erika Doss</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">STARZ</span></p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Hall says Cardi B helped open the door for P-Valley.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a33966657/p-valley-katori-hall-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Elle class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Elle</a>, Hall named the "WAP" and "Bodak Yellow" rapper as a cultural figure that helped stripping become less taboo. She added that the success of the 2019 film Hustlers might have made Hollywood more open to stories about strippers told through the female gaze.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Cardi B literally rolled out the Pynk carpet for P Valley," the playwright told the outlet. "I was following her on social media when she was a dancer because I loved her personality. She was funny as fuck and smart as fuck, and even being young, she was this vibrant and political woman who was articulating herself in this powerful way."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"So fast forward, she just popped, and this story about this stripper-turned-rapper was on everyone's tongue," she continued. "She made other people feel comfortable and be more accepting—and was unapologetic about it the entire time. She was the starting point."</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Hall visited over 40 clubs while researching the series.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2021/05/katori-hall-p-valley-starz-dialogue-emmy-1234762840/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Deadline class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Deadline</a> interview, Hall spoke on her research process for her play, which included visiting several strip clubs and talking to dancers throughout the South. The creator even spent her 30th birthday at a club, during what she called the "heavy research."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I was just really grateful that I was able to really take my time and dig in. Sometimes you just need time to get to the truth, because oftentimes there’s this façade that people will put up," she told the outlet. "I just remember having conversations four and five times with certain women, in order to dig in to the truth as to why they chose to dance. Or, how the dance chose them, and to find out those stories as well."</p><img alt="pvalley true story inspirations" title="p-valley true story inspirations" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/puv2-202-072821-0261-a-1655673917.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Erika Doss</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">STARZ</span></p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Season 2 takes place during the pandemic.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The new season finds The Pynk shut down in the early days of the Rona, with Uncle Clifford and the dancers adapting to their temporary space (a drive-thru show and car wash that's shown in the season opener) and eventually re-opening the club. Hall told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/p-valley-season-2-megan-thee-stallion-1235158635/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Hollywood Reporter</a> that she decided to face the big events of 2020 head on.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I felt like strip clubs, it's a business that's based on gathering and based on intimacy, so what if this big virus comes in and destroys your business model? Boom, that’s high-stakes drama right there," she told the outlet. "In a weird way the strip club was the best place to dig in very specifically to what has been a universal experience for everyone around the world."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As a time capsule of the summer of 2020, season 2 also includes a storyline where the nationwide racial justice protests come to Chucalissa.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I just really wanted to pay homage to our struggle and honor what we went through, that experience, by holding up a mirror and saying, 'I see you. I see what we’ve gone through, and our story is important.' So this is actually a way for us to recognize and move forward and possibly heal."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/81e105b4-86bd-4dab-a1f8-e00063b9e433_1609381211.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" title="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Quinci LeGardye is an LA-based freelance writer who covers culture, politics, and mental health through a Black feminist lens.
