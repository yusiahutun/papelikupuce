However, the Type 003’s aircraft lifts appeared bigger than those of the two operational carriers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Li said the smaller island could save room on the deck to load more aircraft.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It will take several years for sea trials when the Type 003 is launched later this year, and personnel training,” Li added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China began building the third aircraft carrier in 2016, but – like its existing two – it will not be nuclear-powered.
