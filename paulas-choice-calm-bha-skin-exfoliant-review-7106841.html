The gentle version also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nocaes>contains allantoin</a>, a plant extract that soothes and hydrates skin, while healing wounds.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Paula's Choice</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$29 with code <strong>INSTYLE23</strong> (Originally $34); <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">paulaschoice.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To really mitigate any chance of disaster during my test, I skipped all acids and active ingredients and used <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tower28’s calming SOS Serum</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tatcha’s the Water Cream</a>. I very carefully pumped out two pearl-size dollops and applied them to my skin, giving it 48 hours before reexamining.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The first thing I noticed was that nothing there — no redness, sore skin, deep cysts, giant whiteheads, peeling, or flaking. Then, I noticed the blackheads on my nose were noticeably more shallow — like they were closer to the surface. There were also way fewer of those small bumps that typically cover the entirety of my chin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As is to be expected with an exfoliating treatment, there was some purging, but it was of a manageable scope — not so severe that I questioned if I was having an allergic reaction. This was characterized by a couple of surface-level blackheads on my forehead and some headless bumps on my jawline.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since knowing my skin could handle the treatment, I’ve been using <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Calm 1% BHA Sensitive Skin Exfoliant</a> when my skin deems it necessary (more on my new intuitive approach <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>here</a>), which is usually two to three times a week. I have noticed pores and blackheads that seem less deep as time goes on, with some even seemingly disappearing. My skin is brighter, helping me win my constant battle with hyperpigmentation as the marks are less dark and fade faster.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I am elated to finally be able to heed the glass skin-like benefits of one of the most famous skincare products around. While it launched in October 2022, it hasn’t amassed the fanfare surrounding the original, but give it time and the masses will discover <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Paula’s Choice Calm 1% BHA Sensitive Skin Exfoliant</a>.
