"It just felt like a really incredible experience for me and a lot of fun."</p><p>"My parents were kind of separating at the time when this was all going on. And it made it a lot easier for me to play these characters that were figuring it out," she continued. "I just felt so lucky and really blessed by Nancy [Meyers] and Charles [Shyer]. Without this movie, I wouldn’t have gotten the acting bug."</p><p>Lohan added, "How do you not only want to act for the rest of your life after doing a film like this? 'The Parent Trap' is beautiful, it’s timeless and it’s special, it’s just really special. I feel really blessed and really grateful to have been a part of it."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Earlier in the video chat, the actress and her cast fondly remembered Richardson, who died after a tragic skiing accident in 2009.</p><p>"Natasha had such an elegance and grace, and she was so maternal to me," Lohan said, while Quaid described Richardson as "just somebody so giving and so glad to be there and transmitted that joy of being able to do what we do. It just made everything that much better."</p><p>Hendrix explained how Richardson, who passed away at 45, would gush about her husband, <a href=#><strong>Liam Neeson</strong></a>, and their kids.</p><p>"She would come into the hair-and-makeup trailer and she would literally swoon over talking about Liam and her kids, and she would call him 'my Liam,'" Hendrix said. "They truly seemed to have it all, which, to me, made what happened even more heartbreaking."</p><p>Check out the full reunion above to watch Lohan and Quaid reenact the heartwarming father-daughter car scene, learn about some hilarious behind-the-scenes moments, see if Lohan still knows the infamous handshake and more!</p><p><strong>Got a story or tip for us?
