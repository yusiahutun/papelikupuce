Her biological parents divorced when she was only a young girl in middle school. On her website, Lysa shares that they were abused as children, resulting in the separation. At the age of 12, the speaker's mother met her stepdad.</p><p class=align-left>Terkeurst grew up in a Christian home. But, unfortunately, when she was in her sophomore year in college, Lysa lost her 16-month-old sister after being diagnosed with liver failure. This tragic incident shook her faith, and the author <a id=https://proverbs31.org/from-lysa href=# rel="nofollow noopener">turned away</a> from God because she was angry that He was unfair, yet she had done her best to be a good girl.</p><p class=align-left>Her worldview was later challenged by a close friend who Lysa refers to as her ''Bible friend.'' This woman patiently drew Terkeurst back to Christ by encouraging her and sending relevant Bible verses in the various seasons she went through.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/70fdda3d03ca6774.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Fantasia's husband?

In 2018, Lysa announced their divorce, citing Art's infidelity and substance abuse. The unresolved abortion issue was also a recurrent issue in their marriage.</p><p class=align-left>According to Lysa, the couple had tried to save their marriage through counselling, but Art refused to repent and call off his affair.
