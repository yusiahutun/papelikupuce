The entire place is breathtaking, still finding new hideouts. I seriously don’t want to leave and come home. One thing is for sure my 42nd birthday has been MAGICAL."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/12536371f08d-lisa-riley-castle-germany-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eCrkdndBw9vO data-wc=7><strong>Lisa Riley visited Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany</strong></p><p id=eL-S7DoYF8TP data-wc=81>While it isn’t currently possible to get married inside Neuschwanstein Castle, a number of packages are available that offer newlyweds the opportunity to take a horse and carriage ride through the Hohenschwangau valley before having a photoshoot outside the castle – providing a fairytale backdrop to their wedding photos. It would be particularly fitting for Lisa, who recently expressed her desire to try a wedding dress similar to the Alexander McQueen gown Pippa Middleton wore for the royal wedding in 2011.</p><p id=eny2QSyPoJ9O><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: Lisa Riley opens up about her wedding - and reveals her dress will have a regal touch</a></p><p id=e9DCI9-s57mX data-wc=101>Speaking to HELLO! in a Facebook Live interview, Lisa said: "I like the idea of the<strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Pippa Middleton</a> </strong>bum dress because I work so hard on my bum. So if I WAS to think about a dress... if there was a sort of visualisation, then the fact that I spend my life in squat to keep my Pippa Middleton [bum] up -- that would be the case." The doting aunt also wants to make sure that her two nephews Jake and Josh have key roles – and outfits – at her nuptials. "I would want Jakey and Josh looking really funky," she said.</p><p id=eCLHIc44OXDE></p><p style=text-align:center id=eB7EMSVKNzrU data-wc=11><strong>See Lisa Riley talk wedding plans and her dream wedding dress</strong></p><p id=eDOejnjrxnYQ data-wc=73>And it’s unlikely we’ll know where and when Lisa and her partner do tie the knot, as they don’t have any plans to divulge the details beforehand. When asked if she has a date set, the former actress replied: "No and I've said that – I don’t even know why it's interesting. No, we don’t have a date whatsoever and I don’t think we would tell… we would just sort of like disappear."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
