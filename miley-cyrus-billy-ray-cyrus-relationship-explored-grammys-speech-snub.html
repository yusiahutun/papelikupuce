The father-daughter pair would often perform on tour together as well. Billy Ray soon experienced a career resurgence of his own thanks to his featured turn in 2019's "Old Town Road" with Lil Nas X.</p><p id=eYlETR7mqJ0 data-wc=54>However, in 2022, Billy Ray and Tish filed for divorce after nearly 30 years of marriage, although this was the third time they'd done so over the course of their union. The divorce apparently caused a strain in Miley's dynamic with her father, which was further fueled by his engagement to Australian singer FIREROSE.</p><p id=e4D2i82076d data-wc=15><strong>EXPLORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Miley Cyrus' VMAs shocker 10 years later: her transformations in then and now photos</a></p><p id=eylDA6xH6gj data-wc=33>Miley reportedly was uncomfortable with her father's relationship with someone so close to her own age (FIREROSE is 36, five years older than Miley), and <a class=hm-link href=#>seemingly didn't attend their wedding in October 2023</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a6d142986b81-hannah-montana-days.jpg><p id=e-tupUsRLuE data-wc=28>Meanwhile, she remained supportive of her mother when she announced her engagement to Australian actor Dominic Purcell, and was the maid of honor at their wedding last August.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLvmU1sWMt data-wc=14><strong>TRENDING:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Miley Cyrus smile makeover: what has she done to her teeth?
