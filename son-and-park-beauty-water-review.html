There, I said it. As a teenager, a&nbsp;harsh-smelling orange bottle of astringent was a crucial element in my skin scouring routine. Sure, it stung and left my face shiny and sore afterwards…but the pain meant it was working, right?&nbsp;Ugh, so wrong. My struggles with the alchohol-based <a href=# id=auto-tag_toners data-tag=toners>toners</a> of yore scarred me physically and emotionally, and I haven’t tried a toner since. Until now.</p><p>Enter <strong>Son & Park Beauty Water</strong> ($30, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Soko Glam</a>), which has&nbsp;changed my life—and my skin.&nbsp;It’s so good, it’s turned me into a complete toner believer. I’m borderline evangelical about this stuff, and <a href=# rel=nofollow>my glowing skin</a> is my testament.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anua-heartleaf-toner-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/anua-cleansing-oil-tiktok.png><p>First of all, the packaging is amazing. I love the elegant, geometric bottle—it looks so stylish&nbsp;on my bathroom sink. The rectangular shape is easy to grip and control, which you need in a tall bottle like this—no point in accidentally pouring&nbsp;half of it onto the floor as you’re trying to soak a cotton pad. And while we all know that appearance isn’t everything, there’s no shame in admitting that one definitely uses their pretty products more. Or is that just me?</p><p>But the thing that I truly love about this toner&nbsp;is that it’s hydrating, rather than drying. I know: revolutionary! While the alcohol-based astringent toners so common in the US strip skin completely, Beauty Water (which hails from South Korea) is carefully formulated&nbsp;with humectants and ingredients like rosewater to protect skin’s outer layer and make sure that it remains plumped and dewy-feeling all day. And trust me: I’m on a <a href=#>prescription retinoid</a>-topical antibiotic combination that’s powerful enough to strip house paint. If I so much as&nbsp;look at a product that’s drying, I turn into a flaky, sad lizard person. Beauty Water has dramatically reduced the number of mornings I spend trying not to peel scaly skin off my chin (why is it always the chin?) after I wash my face.</p><p>Because that’s the other thing:&nbsp;with ingredients like willow bark and papaya extract, it also gently exfoliates and cleanses—and I have been taking full advantage of that. I use it on a cotton round after washing my face, morning and night, and no matter how good I think I am at removing dirt and makeup, I’m always amazed at the stuff Beauty Water wipes away. Korean beauty brands have a reputation for excellence, and after using this for a couple of weeks, I really see why. My skin is softer and clearer, with better tone—plus it feels juicier and more plumped, which I love. Even my dermatologist says&nbsp;that it’s been helping my skin cope with the punishing&nbsp;anti-acne regimen I’ve been on, which is high praise indeed. It’s become a permanent part of my <a href=# id=auto-tag_skincare data-tag=skincare>skincare</a> routine.</p><p>So if you, like me,&nbsp;were formerly traumatized by toners, you owe it to yourself to give Son & Park a try. It’ll change your life—or at least your complexion.</p><p><strong>More from Daily Makeover: <a href=#>The Beginner’s Guide to K-Beauty Brands</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWSCd4CRaW9oq5%2BjeqK6w2anmqqbYq%2BmrdStsGavkamys3nRnq2inadk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jack-grealish-tries-chat-love-islands-natalia-zoppa-hes-called-boyfriend-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jack Grealish 'tries to chat up Love Island's Natalia Zoppa'- but he's called out by her boyfriend</span></a>
