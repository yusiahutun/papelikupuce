It works by installing a client program on the device you want to control the computer from (called the "local" device) and a server program on the computer you want to control (called the "remote" device).</p><p>Once both programs are installed and configured, you can connect to the remote device from the local device and control it as if you were sitting in front of it.</p><p>If you're moving your PC because of noise, you could use a quiet device such as a tablet computer or fanless laptop connected to a <a href=#>screen</a>, <a href=#>speakers</a>, <a href=#>mouse</a>, and <a href=#>keyboard</a>, remoting to your loud and powerful computer. Some <a href=#>smart TVs</a> support remote desktop apps, and you can use a <a href=#>wireless or wired mouse</a> and keyboard with them, so a living room setup is possible too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/41unygu7agl-_sl160_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>2022 Apple MacBook Air Laptop with M2 chip</h5>$960 <span class=regular-price>$1099</span> Save $139<p class=display-card-description>Apple's second-generation Apple Silicon MacBook Air has no fans and makes no noise, but comes with all-day battery life and oodles of CPU and GPU performance for every day users.</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$960 at Amazon</a><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Bestbuy</a><p>There are many different remote desktop software options available, each with its own set of features and pricing.

This is generally a better solution than remote desktop software, since Steam in-home streaming is designed for gaming in particular, minimizing <a href=#>latency</a> while maximizing image quality. Several smart TV models have access to the Steam Remote Play app, along with numerous mobile devices and, of course, personal computers that can run Steam.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Can You Build a Fanless Desktop PC?</a></span></p><h2 id=hdmi-and-usb-with-extenders>HDMI and USB (With Extenders)</h2><p>Given that few computer users still use physical media such as DVDs, there's little reason to have physical access to the computer other than to turn it on and off, which is another thing fewer people actually do. You can also configure your computer to turn on over the network.</p><p>In other words, as long as you have access to your peripherals. it doesn't really matter where the actual computer is.

However, <a href=#>longer lengths</a> may be possible with lower resolutions or lower refresh rates, or with the use of signal repeaters or active HDMI cables. The maximum passive length should be more than enough for a cable passed through an adjacent wall, but if you really want to push it, active extenders will let you chain cables to the required length.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/31bwhoju-jl-_sl160_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Cable Matters Active HDMI to HDMI Repeater</h5><p class=display-card-description>This affordable active HDMI repeater lets you increase the maximum HDMI length at 4K 60Hz to 60 ft.</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$18 at Amazon</a><p>You can use an HDMI audio extractor, or the headphone jack on your monitor to get audio out of the HDMI signal.

For USB 3.0 and 3.1, the maximum length is longer, at 9.84 feet (3 meters). It's worth noting that these are the maximum lengths for standard cables; <a href=#>using a longer cable</a> or a cable with active repeaters can allow you to extend the distance further, but may result in reduced performance or reliability.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/417g1tlv1fl-_sl160_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>MutecPower 16 Feet Active USB 3.0 Extension Cable 3.0</h5><p class=display-card-description>This active USB 3.0 cable starts at 16 feet and is available in lengths up to 100 feet.

They are typically thin and flexible, and can support longer lengths than copper Thunderbolt cables.

This only works with Thunderbolt 3, not USB!</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Amazon</a><p>It's worth noting that optical Thunderbolt cables are generally much more expensive than copper Thunderbolt cables, and <a href=#>may not be supported by all devices</a>. You will need to check the specifications of your devices to determine if they are compatible with optical Thunderbolt cables.</p><p>Also, bear in mind that optical Thunderbolt cables don't carry power, only data. So you'll need a powered Thunderbolt dock to connect your peripherals. Many modern laptops come with Thunderbolt, but you can purchase a PCIe Thunderbolt add-on card if your desktop system does not have a compatible Thunderbolt port.</p><p>With all of these different solutions on the table you don't have to sit right next to your computer anymore. If it <a href=#>sounds like a jet engine</a>, you don't have to spend a fortune building a silent PC. You don't have to hurt your back lugging it around your home when you want to use it in another room, either, and you can easily <a href=#>free up desk space</a> by keeping it in another room full-time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Organize All the Cables Under Your Desk</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhvbm1ma4VwtM6wZK2nXarApnnYqKyrZaCYeqe%2BzqZkmqafqbWmvoyrpqilXam8sLjSZrCorV2jsqawjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./evening-work-from-home-jobs.html><span>←</span><span>Evening Work From Home Jobs: 7 Easy Way to Earn Extra Money</span></a>
