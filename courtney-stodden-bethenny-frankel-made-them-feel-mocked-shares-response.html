"To be 19, to not go into porn and to forge a new path. I was supportive of that choice, which you didn't show in any of your clips."</p><p>The message went on to note that Stodden was "certainly" marketing herself differently then and apologized if anything she'd said "upset or stuck" with Stodden.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:fcbfc360-4d0b-5441-9e9e-e173b272c20a data-container-ref=toofab:article:d1cfcd69-edca-4666-b799-3302d8ba06d3 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6a/5by4/2020/03/03/6a693682029053aa8733eae5e8fa9762_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Courtney Stodden Says She Was 'Groomed' As a Child Bride and 'Verbally Abused' by Doug Hutchison</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Perhaps our conversation did contribute to the positive path that you embarked on," the message continued. "I do think about young women very much as a mother, and I believe that you changed your course and direction. That's inspirational. B"</p><p>Stodden clearly did not receive this last part of the message well at all, posting in the caption to the share, "No @bethennyfrankel you do not deserve credit for my healing process!" They even tossed in hashtags including "gaslit," "mentalhealth" and "womensupportingwomen."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"That conversation helped fan the flames of the public and internet fodder concerning my personal life," Stodden wrote. They opened the message, "She's hunting women left and right."</p><p>In their initial post, Stodden shared their experience on Frankel's show in response to Frankel calling out the Kardashians as "irresponsible" for allegedly altering their social media pictures to create an unrealistic and "unfair" standard for women.</p><p>"Is this somebody that shows empathy towards children who have been abused? Or who actually cares about women’s mental health? And is supportive towards women?" Stodden captioned their share of video clips from the appearance where Frankel says Stodden is "looking like you could be at a strip club," and noting that they look "promiscuous."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:14fcf010-d1dc-4731-941c-6513b3082408 data-container-ref=toofab:article:d1cfcd69-edca-4666-b799-3302d8ba06d3 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d5/5by4/2022/08/10/d5c6813b3eb44de79a37ea1ba37b3ed8_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">TikTok / Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Bethenny Frankel Gives VERY FRANK Review of Kim Kardashian's Skincare Line on TikTok</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Hmm @bethennyfrankel maybe you should let @kimkardashian be @kimkardashian," Stodden wrote in their caption to that post.</p><p>Sharing another clip from the appearance, Stodden shared, "I canceled all my other interviews in nyc and immediately returned back to LA crying my eyes out. She didn’t try to help me, she allowed members of her audience to laugh at me. It hurt me deeply. That also causes insecurities, depression which added to MY own eating disorder."</p><p>They called Frankel "hypocritical," but also insisted that despite how difficult it was at the time, they're fine now, "I just can’t deal with the championing women ???"</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><a id=gallery-link-6a32bd7d-09ac-44a5-a9ea-e043c4aaa7c0 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:6a32bd7d-09ac-44a5-a9ea-e043c4aaa7c0 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:d1cfcd69-edca-4666-b799-3302d8ba06d3 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a4/4by3/2022/08/31/a4eb61bcb3174396b0a7eda7bdfc2630_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3JmaWxfmLy2vtOnnLJlo6m8pbDEp2SbnaSdsq%2B62Gadq5meoLKtecyam55lpJ2yrnnFnpylZZ2ksKyxw2aqoZmimsBuvsSsp6imo5p8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bella-hadid-new-way-to-wear-sweater.html><span>←</span><span>Bella Hadid Just Invented a New Way to Wear a Sweater</span></a>
