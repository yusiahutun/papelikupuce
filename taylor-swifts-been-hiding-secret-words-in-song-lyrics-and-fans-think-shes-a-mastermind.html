The first word, on Saturday, April 13 was hidden in the lyrics of Glitch, where the letters H, E, Y, B, E, and R were capitalized, which unscrambled to Hereby. Swifties were directed to the song when a clue on Swift’s team’s <a href=#>Instagram</a> story started to… glitch.</p><p>On Sunday, the word Conduct was hidden in the hit single, Peace.</p><p>As the clues and answers float around X, formerly known as <a href=#>Twitter</a>, fans can’t help but comment on how clever the ‘technique’ is. “That’s so smart, like this woman is a mastermind for that,” wrote one fan.</p><p>“You just gotta give her 10s for how smart she is,” wrote another.</p><p>A third penned: “This is so OG Taylor and I love it!!”</p><p>Others were trying to determine what the message could mean from the first two words, “I think it’ll be something like ‘I hereby conduct this meeting to order’ with the last word being on Thursday,” one Reddit user <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">suggested</a>.</p><p>Not long to wait until we find out!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-and-travis-enjoy-time-at-coachella>Taylor and Travis enjoy time at Coachella</h2><p>For a change, Taylor is actually the one in the crowd this time. She’s been seen living it up in the desert with Travis Kelce as she enjoys time off from her worldwide Eras Tour.</p><p>On Saturday, the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> were seen adorably dancing in the crowd along to Jack Antonoff’s band, Bleachers.</p><p>In another adorable clip, the Kansas City Chiefs star can be seen lifting the singer up, so she could get a better view of the stage to see Dom Dolla playing.</p><p>We can’t cope with these two!</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2aCcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy06xkm52Vo3qptcOipaBlo5qws7HTZq6oqpSoeqq6jKymp59docaztcKsZJqmlGKzorrSZquhoZ6gerS0xKxkmmWdlsC1sdGmoKecXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mimi-rocah.html><span>←</span><span>Mimi Rocah Biography</span></a>
