Why did nobody tell me that roasted (or grilled, if you’ve got one) chicken wings were the ultimate weekday night dinner savior? You cannot mess them up. They’re done in just over 30 minutes in the oven, but even if you, say, left them in 20 minutes longer, they’re just fine, which I know from experience. They take on the flavor of whatever you pour over them without requiring a multi-hour or overnight marinade because seriously, who plans that far ahead for a 30 minute meal? (See above: probably people who aren’t me.) And it turns out, if you’ve got the kind of 4.75 year-old that isn’t usually inclined to embrace new foods, they may actually go berserk for what they think are baby drumsticks. They might eat a frightening amount. You might have to bite your tongue when this happens, because you know by now it might never happen again. And then you can make them again next week, when you forget to plan for dinner again.</p><p><a title="sticky sesame chicken wings" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3835/14590650012_3e862fbc9a_z.jpg alt="sticky sesame chicken wings" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>Weeknight Favorites</b>: <a href=#>A new and long-overdue category</a>.

I think a little grated fresh ginger could be good in here, as well as a dash or two of Sriracha. We had this with rice (I’m currently enamored with <a href=#>this</a> and <a href=#>this</a>) and roasted asparagus.

Spread wings and any sauce that fell to the bottom of the bowl out on the prepared baking pan in one layer. Roast, turning over once, until cooked through, about 35 minutes. Transfer wingettes to a large serving bowl* and toss with sesame seeds and scallion.</p><p>* If you end up with a puddle of sauce in the bottom of your baking pan (I did the one time they were more tightly packed in a dish), after removing the wings, you can pour the extra sauce into a saucepan and reduced it until thick, then stir it over the roasted wings before adding the sesame seeds and scallion.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-12212 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-12212 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
