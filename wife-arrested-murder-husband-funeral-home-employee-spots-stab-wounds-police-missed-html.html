 A woman has been arrested and charged with the murder of her husband who was originally thought to have died in a car accident after a funeral home employee discovered stab wounds.
The family of David Lokeith Worley, who died on July 19 in North Carolina, contacted Unity Funeral Home and voiced their suspicions about his death after they ruled he died as a result of injuries sustained in a car accident."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
