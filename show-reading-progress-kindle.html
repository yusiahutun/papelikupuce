First, open up any book you want and tap near the top of the screen. This brings up another panel where you'll find a button labeled <strong>Aa</strong>, which is the <strong>Settings</strong> button.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot-of-kindle-reading-screen.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot-of-kindle-reading-screen-with-menu-options.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>This will bring up a menu at the bottom of your screen containing all the adjustable <a href=#>options to improve your Kindle reading experience</a>. For instance, you can change the theme of your books, <a href=#>change the Kindle font size</a>, or, you guessed it, show your reading progress.</p><p>The options for reading progress appear when you tap the section labeled <strong>More</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot-of-kindle-reading-progress-menu.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot-of-kindle-showing-reading-progress-options.jpeg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>After that, tap <strong>Reading Progress </strong>to view your options. You can see your reading progress by showing <strong>page in book</strong>, <strong>time left in book</strong>, <strong>time left in chapter</strong>, and <strong>location in book</strong>. Choose any of these options, and then simply tap anywhere on your page to close the settings panel and carry on reading. Your reading progress is displayed in the bottom left of your reading screen and is updated each time you turn a page.</p><h2 id=how-to-change-reading-progress-display-on-kindle>How to Change Reading Progress Display on Kindle</h2><p>Whichever one you choose, you can always change it to another option easily. Simply tap the reading progress figure on the bottom-left corner of your screen to cycle through each of the options available.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Each tap will bring up a new measurement in the following order: <strong>page in book</strong>, <strong>time left in chapter</strong>, <strong>time left in book</strong>, <strong>location</strong>, <strong>off</strong>.</p><p>This shortcut proves especially useful if you want a quick way to turn off reading progress when you're so absorbed in your book, and you don't want any on-screen distractions. It means you won't need to break your concentration by leaving the page to navigate the Kindle menu.</p><h2 id=understanding-the-reading-progress-options-on-your-kindle>Understanding the Reading Progress Options on Your Kindle</h2><p>The <strong>time left in book</strong> or <strong>time left in chapter</strong> are calculated based on the speed at which you flip through pages. In our experience, it's usually a little off, so you should subtract a few minutes from whatever time you get. In general, however, Kindel's reading progress is good for providing a rough estimate of how long the chapter or book is.</p><p><strong>Location in book</strong> provides a string of numbers that aren't generally very helpful, as there's no context to tell you how much of the book you've read. The <strong>page in book</strong> option will tell you how many pages you'd be if the ebook were a paper book; this is only available on Kindle-purchased ebooks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-can-take-your-pick>You Can Take Your Pick</h2><p>These are all in-book methods of viewing your reading progress on your Kindle. When you're back in your library, the percentage of each book you've read is displayed on the cover.</p><p>Remember that you can choose any of the options we mentioned above and switch between them with just one tap. There's no right answer here, so pick whatever will help you make the most of your Kindle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiqoaenYr%2BmrcOipaBloKe8qL7ErKpmo5mjsa2xjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./f-22-stealth-fighter-pilot-reveals-forced-air-force-racism-html.html><span>←</span><span>F-22 stealth fighter pilot reveals he was forced out of Air Force by racism</span></a>
