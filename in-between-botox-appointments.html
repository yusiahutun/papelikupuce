By the time we're 50, there is almost no new <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>collagen</a> being made, and the collagen that remains becomes broken down, fragmented, and weaker. This loss of collagen and elastin shows up on the skin as wrinkles, fine lines, and skin laxity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's therefore really important to use high quality skin care products on a consistent basis. For me, the trifecta of an "anti-aging" routine that everyone should be on in some form is: a broad spectrum SPF 30+ every morning (ideally something tinted to protect from visible blue light as well as UV rays), as well as an antioxidant vitamin C serum to help even skin pigmentation and fight free radical damage. At night, opt for a retinoid — ideally prescription — which helps to build collagen, can minimize pores, and even tone and pigment. Peptides are also key to boosting production of collagen and elastin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you are open to more invasive treatments, dermatologists can inject neuromodulators, like botulinum toxin, also known as Botox, to relax particular facial muscles. This helps to soften existing wrinkles and stop the development of deeper, etched lines on the forehead, between the brows, and around the eyes, which can result in crows feet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We also use it to sculpt the jawline and lift the neck — by injecting the thick muscular neck/platysma bands — as well as to reduce the appearance of a widened jawline and prominent masseter/chewing muscles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is by far the most popular cosmetic procedure I perform in my office. Treatments, such as botulinum toxin, fillers, and lasers help round out a balanced routine for aging skin and need to be maintained a few times a year. And they are best used when coupled with a great skincare routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything I suggest you do in-between your Botox appointments to keep your skin looking its best.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-wear-sunscreen-every-single-day></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Wear Sunscreen Every Single Day</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It is important to continue to wear <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sunscreen</a> every day, even when indoors. UV light is the ultimate ager, and longer UVA rays (the rays that cause wrinkles, sunspots, and skin cancer) can travel through windows. So unless you have zero windows in your home, you are still susceptible to UV damage. It's also important to re-apply. During the day, you can use a mineral powder SPF over your makeup to make things easier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to UV light, blue light is also a real concern as we are staring at our computer and phone screens much more as we work from home. I recommend tinted sunscreens with iron oxide, as well as antioxidants in the morning to help protect the skin from these HEV blue light rays that we know can contribute to hyperpigmentation of the skin and may also cause collagen breakdown and contribute to wrinkles, although the evidence is less clear.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-and-dont-forget-about-retinoids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>And Don't Forget About Retinoids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you use an over-the-counter formula or prescription strength, retinoids are an essential part of any skin care routine, especially for those interested in anti-aging benefits. They work by increasing collagen production as well as increasing the rate of skin cell turnover. They also improve the texture of skin and give it a glow, along with minimizing fine lines and wrinkles, evening out skin tone, and decreasing pore size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I recommend using them at night.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ideally, apply a small pea sized amount to the entire face 30 minutes after washing your face. Start off only using it three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) as dryness and peeling can be expected for four to six weeks. The prescription strengths retinoids (i.e. tretinoin, retin a micro, Tazorac) will be stronger and more effective, but over the counter options, such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Differin 0.1% gel</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Cerave Skin Renewing Day Cream</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair</a> are especially good for beginners or those with sensitive skin, since they are a lower strength than prescription versions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Skinbetter Alpharet</a> is one of my favorite cosmeceutical grade retinoids and contains so many antioxidant and anti-aging ingredients including retinol, glycolic acid, niacinamide, ubiquinone, squalane, ceramides, and hyaluronic acid.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Dermatologists Use This Anti-Aging Eye Cream in Their Own Routines</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-add-in-peptides></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Add in Peptides</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Peptides can help boost production of collagen and elastin, which improves the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. My favorite is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>No7 Laboratories Line Correcting Booster Serum</a>. The key ingredient in this product is a proprietary blend of peptides, called Matrixyl 3000 Plus, which boosts skin's production of elastic fibrillin and is used specifically to soften the appearance of individual deeper lines.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Skinbetter Interfuse Eye Cream</a> has a combo of peptides, antioxidants, glycerin, niacinamide, and caffeine for the delicate eyelid skin to hydrate and reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles as well as dark circles. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Alastin Restorative Skin Complex</a> with Trihex peptide technology is great for the whole face.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-use-an-antioxidant-serum></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Use an Antioxidant Serum</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An effective and high-quality antioxidant serum is a key morning step in every daily skincare routine. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that helps protect from and repair free radical damage, can reduce the appearance of brown spots, and even out skin tone and hyperpigmentation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Serums containing this ingredient protect the skin from oxidative free radical damage and therefore work best in the morning. Vitamin C also plays a critical role in the formation of collagen. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Skinceuticals Phloretin</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Skinbetter Alto Defense</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>ISDIN Flavo C</a> ampules are some of my favorite medical-grade antioxidant vitamin C serums.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Ole Henriksen Truth Serum</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Olay Tone Perfection Serum</a> with vitamin C and B3, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>L'Oreal Revitalift Vitamin C Serum</a> are over the counter options to try for those who don't want to make the immediate splurge. But keep in mind that these cosmeceuticals are not FDA regulated and I have no studies comparing the efficacy and clinical benefit of the over-the-counter options.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-stay-in-touch-with-your-dermatologist></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Stay in Touch with Your Dermatologist</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If elective procedures interest you, check in with your dermatologist.
