<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Dwayne Haskins Bio, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Wiki</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Dwayne Haskins was an American football quarterback who plays for the National Football League’s Pittsburgh Steelers (NFL). He was a quarterback at Ohio State University, where he threw 50 touchdowns in his lone starting season, making him one of only seven quarterbacks in NCAA history to accomplish so in a single season.</p><p>He was a finalist for the Maxwell Award and the Heisman Trophy after winning multiple Big Ten conference honors. Haskins was picked in the first round of the 2019 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins. However, he was released after less than two seasons owing to both ineffective on-field play and failure to satisfy the team’s off-field expectations.</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Dwayne Haskins Jr. was born in Highland Park, New Jersey on May 3, 1997. Haskins participated in the USA vs. World game in Ohio in 2011. Even though he was an eighth-grader at the time of the game, Haskins wowed everyone with his attention to detail. His family relocated to Potomac, Maryland, with his family when he was in ninth grade. From 2013 until 2016, he attended Bullis School and played football there, passing for 5,308 yards and 54 touchdowns.</p><p>Haskins used to carry a football in his backpack during his high school years. Dwayne would arrive early for practice to help with receivers on footwork drills. Haskins Sr., as well as Haskins’ mother and sister, would come to the practice location around 9 p.m. for one or two hours of practice. Haskins received offers from 38 colleges. He chose the University of Maryland over Rutgers to play college football, but after Randy Edsall was fired midway through the season, he changed his mind and chose Ohio State.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u67ac1d63a6bac92be320484bb6e9448d><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Jaylen Waddle Biography</span></a><h3>Dwayne Haskins Career</h3><h4>College</h4><p>In 2016, Haskins redshirted his freshman year at Ohio State. He was J.T. Barrett’s backup the following year. He completed 40 of 57 throws for 565 yards and four touchdowns on the season. In the 2018 Big Ten Football Championship Game, he threw for 499 yards and five touchdowns, and in the 2019 Rose Bowl, he threw for three touchdowns, earning him MVP honors in both games.</p><p>He also received first-team All-Big Ten accolades, six Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week awards, the Graham–George Offensive Player of the Year, the Griese–Brees Quarterback of the Year, the Chicago Tribune Silver Football, and the Male Ohio State Athlete of the Year trophies for his efforts. He was also a Semifinalist for the Maxwell Award and came in third place in the Heisman Trophy vote. Haskins declared in January 2019 that he would forego his last two years of college football and join the 2019 NFL Draft. He majored in journalism from his college.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>The Washington Redskins selected Haskins 15th overall in the first round of the 2019 NFL Draft. He used to wear jersey number 7 in both high school and college days, but&nbsp;jersey number 7 had been unofficially retired by the Redskins in honor of quarterback Joe Theismann. As his career ended in 1985 due to a leg injury, he asked him to wear jersey number 7, and eventually, Joe allowed him to wear it.</p><p>On May 9, 2019, Haskins signed a four-year rookie deal. Haskins made his NFL debut in Week 4 against the New York Giants, filling in for Case Keenum, who was benched due to poor performance. Haskins made his first career start against the Buffalo Bills the next week, throwing for 144 yards in a 24–9 loss.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ucbb9de40e3132508b701071e2dd55467><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Dylan DeLucia Biography</span></a><h3>2020 Season</h3><p>Haskins dropped almost 7% of his total body fat before the 2020 season and was selected as the starter and one of the team captains. Coaches were displeased with Haskins’ work ethic and performance, therefore he was benched before the Week 5 game against the Los Angeles Rams. He was fined $40,000 by the squad and lost his captaincy after breaking COVID-19 protocols for the second time.</p><p>Despite this, he started the next game against the Carolina Panthers before being replaced in the fourth quarter by Taylor Heinicke. The next day, Haskins was released by the team, with head coach Ron Rivera stating that it was in the best interests of both parties if they parted ways. Other claims of him making poor decisions and failing to match the team’s standards off the field prompted his departure. Haskins signed a futures contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers on January 21, 2021.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Dwayne Haskins Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Dwayne Haskins Jr.</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>3 May 1997</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2021)</td><td>24 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Highland Park, New Jersey, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Taurus</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dwayne-Haskins-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 6’ 4” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 193 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 99 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 218 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>15 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Athletic</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Dwayne Haskins Sr.</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Tamara Haskins</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>Bullis School</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>Ohio State University</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dwayne-Haskins-3.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Is he a Gay?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Wife</td><td><a href=# rel=noopener>Kalabrya Gondrezick-Haskins</a></td></tr></tbody></table><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u71cd96a83ebd9e50662ba84c4abe0508><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Austin Eckroat Biography</span></a><h3>Personal life</h3><p>Dwayne Haskins Sr. is his father’s name, and Tamara Haskins is his mother’s name.
