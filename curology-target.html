It used to work by taking a photo of your skin and uploading it to the Curology website, where skilled dermatologists examined the type of acne you had, and then put you on a Curology regimen that’s tailored to your skin’s condition and type. Of course, that method of care is still available, and today, you can even get prescription-only tretinoin, azelaic acid, and more.&nbsp;But now, you can pick up <a href=# rel=noopener>Curology skincare essentials like pimple patches, moisturizers, and more at Target.</a></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anua-heartleaf-toner-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/beauty-of-joseon-fi.jpg><p>You can still get customized acne-fighting formulas that get shipped directly to your door at <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Curology</a>, but the essentials you’ll always need a restock of have officially launched in stores and online.

If you’re on prescription acne medication that’s outside of Curology, these make a great addition to your routine that will naturally help replenish the moisture-loss caused by the harsh acne-fighting ingredients typically found in prescriptions. Here’s everything you can pick up now that we’re loving from the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Curology launch at Target.</a></p><p class=p1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do. <a href=# id=auto-tag_target data-tag=target>Target</a> is a STYLECASTER sponsor, however, all products in this article were independently selected by our editors.
