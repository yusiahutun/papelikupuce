The 'What Kinda Gone' hitmaker's representatives didn't respond to requests for comment. Greenville is approximately 45 miles northeast of Dallas.</p><p>Cagle, 45, has had brushes with the law before. In May 2008, he and his girlfriend were arrested on <a href=#>domestic assault charges</a> after a verbal argument turned physical. At the time, police said the couple had been drinking prior to the incident. Several months earlier, the country singer was <a href=#>arrested</a> and charged with assault after an altercation with the boyfriend of a fan. The woman became belligerent when Cagle refused to sign an autograph, and things escalated from there.</p><p>He's spoken openly about personal struggles, and at times, he's admitted to giving up alcohol completely.&nbsp;“I quit drinking. I quit smoking,” he told the <a href=#>Boot</a> in 2008. “I dip Skoal every once in awhile when I get nervous.”</p><p>Cagle's last album was 'Back in the Saddle,' released in 2012. It produced two Top 20 hits in 'Got My Country On' and 'Let There Be Cowgirls.' His biggest hits include the chart-topping 'I Breathe In, I Breathe Out' from 2001, 'What a Beautiful Day' from 2002 and 'Chicks Dig It' from 2003, although he's charted songs sporadically across the last decade.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnKCinsBur8Cgo55lkae%2Fpr%2FTnpto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./china-rallies-aviation-brainpower-get-widebody-c929-ground-amp-airbus-and-boeing-competition.html><span>←</span><span>China rallies aviation brainpower to get widebody C929 off the ground, amp up Airbus and Boeing comp</span></a>
