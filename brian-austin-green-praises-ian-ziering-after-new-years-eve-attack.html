What is certain is that he stepped out of his vehicle and was immediately assailed by multiple bikers in the brazen New Year's Eve attack.</p><p>The situation escalated almost immediately, with Ziering defending &nbsp;himself and seemingly giving better than he was getting until he gets ganged up on. All the while, his 10-year-old daughter Penna was terrified in the car as bikers bashed the windshield in with their helmets, as shown by additional <a href=#><strong>TMZ</strong></a> footage.</p><p>Ziering spoke out about the attack on his Instagram, assuring fans that both he and his daughter are fine. He called for LA officials to do something about the "growing boldness of such groups," nothing the daylight attack underscores a problem with "hooliganism on our streets and the need for effective law enforcement responses to such behavior."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:182763c5-541f-44c0-aa0a-b00c38c12204 data-container-ref=toofab:article:daba455d-6abf-4b7a-8a87-79f5dd4a3acb data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/06/5by4/2023/09/25/06bab6a029334aea8018b7853c9f6367_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">How Brian Austin Green and Megan Fox's Kids Reacted to His Engagement to Sharna Burgess</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"As a citizen and a parent, I find it unacceptable that groups can freely engage in this kind of behavior, causing fear and chaos, while the response from authorities seems insufficient," Ziering added.</p><p>On Tuesday, his longtime pal Green weighed in on his <a href=#><strong>Instagram Stories</strong></a>. "Hey so I didn't get a chance to get into this at all," he told his followers. "My boy Ian Ziering got into a fistfight on Hollywood Boulevard with like five dudes, and f--king like beat them, did it, did his thing."</p><p>"He's a monster. He's f--king incredibly fit, obviously," Green continued. "I would not suggest, to anyone, to fight people, especially not now in this climate. But, you know what? All turned out well.

According to <a href=#><strong>TMZ</strong></a>, authorities have plenty to work with as the attack was in the daylight, there are cameras all up and down that section of the street and there is plenty of cell phone footage.</p><p>The police are also saying this is not an isolated incident, per the outlet. They recommend that anyone who finds themselves in a similar situation call 911 from inside their vehicle, rather than getting out as Ziering did.</p><a id=gallery-link-57f5a905-bf2f-47bf-8264-7e2d5550194a class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:57f5a905-bf2f-47bf-8264-7e2d5550194a data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:daba455d-6abf-4b7a-8a87-79f5dd4a3acb data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6e/4by3/2020/07/27/6e1df874718646c58f27061edc77a2c6_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pmaWtfl7%2Bqrc1mmK6rpJ67brPRnpynZaCnrqq%2FxKxkopmeYseqsdGipaBlkZvBpr6Mp5ywZamarrO%2FjJ6tnmWRqcGir8po</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./olga-tanon.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Olga Tan dating?
