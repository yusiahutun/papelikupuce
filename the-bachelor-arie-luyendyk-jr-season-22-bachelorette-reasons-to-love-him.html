Then again, such authenticity runs the risk of boring the average "Bachelor" viewer, but <strong><a href=#>TooFab</a></strong> has seen the premiere episode, and we're confident a few wild contestants vying for Arie's heart will fill the void by stirring up drama.</p><p>Arie has actually been a "Bachelor" front-runner for quite some time. He was supposed to take on the coveted reality role a few years ago, and even went as far as filming the introduction package, but Warner Bros. shut it down because executives wanted someone more relevant - AKA hunky farmer <strong><a href=#>Chris Soules</a></strong>.</p><p>Now that Arie is finally up at bat, here are five reasons to root for him when the new season of "The Bachelor" premieres on ABC Monday night.</p><h2 class=h2>He's Mature and There For the Right Reasons</h2><p>Arie is way older than the majority of the men who have signed up for the job, which means he is over his playboy days and ready to settle down. We know it's been awhile, but it's refreshing to have Arie become the man in charge since he had the opportunity to grow up and learn the qualities that he is looking for during the time he spent away from reality tv.</p><p>Since it has been so long, it will also be more entertaining for viewers to watch these relationships blossom because the one-on-one conversations won't be so one-sided. For viewers who are new to Bachelor Nation, the conversations on the show usually revolve around the contestant because viewers and contestants alike already learned everything there is to know about the Bachelor while he was talking about himself to the Bachelorette the season prior.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:68f36973-4a40-5d7f-9af6-ce24ef5aafc3 data-container-ref=toofab:article:dcbdfca6-d5cf-556e-ab60-ccbf2171311b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b7/5by4/2017/10/07/b7d5c07ae54256c1b178ac32b5881e20_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Peter Kraus Gets Second Chance at Love and Everything Else We Know About 'The Bachelor Winter Games'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>He's Drama Free</h2><p>Arie never got involved in all of the drama when he was in the Bachelor mansion. He mostly minded his own business and focused on more important tasks: doing whatever he could to kiss Emily.</p><p>Now that tables are turned and women will be trying to score alone time with him, we expect to see a Bachelor who takes decisive action and swipes left on contestants who feel entitled to his heart.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3b9396ed-3dca-5c2b-a136-6e51362f1a17 data-container-ref=toofab:article:dcbdfca6-d5cf-556e-ab60-ccbf2171311b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b0/5by4/2017/09/07/b04f6e64d1385d02938521ec72794c14_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Bachelor' Fans Baffled Over ABC's Random Pick: The Most Savage Reactions</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>He Used to Be a Race Car Driver</h2><p>How cool is that?</p><p>Arie had the need for speed since he was a child, growing up with a two-time Indianapolis 500 winner as a father. Arie continued in his father's tracks by placing in the top five numerous times at the Indy Lights Series. We would not be surprised if he takes his favorite ladies on a spin around the race track this season. In fact, we're looking forward to it.</p><p>Arie eventually took a break from racing to compete on the 8th season of "The Bachelorette," where he placed second. After clearly getting his heart broken in front of America, he went back to his own reality and unlike other contestants, he stayed out of the limelight and became a successful real estate agent in Arizona, instead. We give him points for moving on with his life while so many other men in the Bachelor Nation have tried desperately to milk their 15 minutes of fame for all its worth.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:706ab90c-aec5-5cc9-9572-519271a21744 data-container-ref=toofab:article:dcbdfca6-d5cf-556e-ab60-ccbf2171311b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f4/5by4/2017/08/31/f4b53ebfdbef5b74a0865973327985c7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>5 Contenders to Be 'The Bachelor': The Good, the Bad and the Handsome</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>He's the Best Kisser on the Show</h2><p>It's true, even host <strong><a href=#>Chris Harrison</a></strong> said it: Arie is known to be one of the best kissers to ever step foot in the Bachelor mansion.</p><p>As a "Bachelorette" contestant, Arie earned his nickname "The Kissing Bandit" because he always found a way to kiss Emily when she wasn't expecting it.</p><p>Between Arie figuring out a way to make kissing sessions in dark ally ways romantic to his slow hands caressing the woman's neck that he's embracing, he clearly knows what he's doing -- so much so, #TeamArie fans even created a YouTube video to teach men how to kiss like the newest Bachelor.</p><p>If you forgot what those intimate Arie kisses look like, you'll see him show off his skills twice during the first episode.</p><h2 class=h2>He's a Role Model for Boys Amid the #MeToo Movement</h2><p>We know you wanted to watch the obvious fan favorites, Dean and Peter, fall in love with whatever hotties producers threw at them, but producers threw us all a curveball instead by casting Arie.</p><p>He's not particularly exciting, sure, but he has proven to be a gentleman, which is exactly what women say they want. His personality seems particularly fitting for 2018, given that the #MeToo movement will no doubt continue to out pigs while Arie's dating adventures air on ABC. (And yes, we're crossing our fingers he doesn't have any sexual misconduct skeletons hiding in his closet.)</p><p>We've seen so many disrespectful men on "The Bachelorette" and even a few on "The Bachelor" (Juan Pablo Galavis, anybody?), the franchise was getting stale. We have entered a period in history when inappropriate behavior is no longer tolerated.</p><p>While we've seen plenty of famous men unwittingly serve of examples of how not to treat women, we think Arie is a strong candidate to show boys and men, alike, how a man should behave.</p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fc/o/2017/08/25/fc3cf755fac253a08dd5cca3ee8c951b_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnh7kGtmbGlfqbWmecGamqGdnKS%2Fbq3RopxmpKWusq%2Bw2KRko6pdqLKiv86nZGtqXZeupLTEpaarnaSpsm6%2BxJqqqKajYsGwecuorZ5lmJ66cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./k-c-armstrong.html><span>←</span><span>Who is K.C.
