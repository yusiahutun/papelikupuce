Throughout the years, the former Academy Awards host has opened up about his daughter plenty of times during his late night show.</p><p>When she was four years old, he told the audience about her birthday party, where she had a pretty hilarious response to her PAW Patrol-themed bash. “For her birthday she asked for a PAW Patrol piñata,” he said at the time. “And we got her one, and it was a terrible piñata. It wasn’t even shaped like anything, just a rectangle with four dogs on it, one of which was Chase, that’s her favorite dog.”</p><p>“Finally, they cracked this thing open and the candy comes out and they all dive in and fight each other for it,” Kimmel recalled. That’s when his wife, McNearney, noticed Jane staring at the sad remains of her piñata “in little puppy pieces on the ground.” Kimmel shared, “Jane looks at it, and says to no one in particular, ‘I can’t believe we beat up Chase.’ And then she goes—and I don’t know where she got this—but she goes, ‘Look at these guys, they never saw it coming.'”</p><p>While she may be one of his youngest, Jane is evidently pretty bright. “My daughter is very precocious,” the comedian also told People in September 2022. His daughter, who was eight years old at the time, had “just lost a tooth,” which meant that the late night show host had to remember to put money under her pillow from the Tooth Fairy. At the time, he joked that she might be expecting a large sum after he and his wife, comedic writer Molly McNearney, forgot to grab some smaller bills for when she lost her first tooth. “Last time, I forgot and I had to throw a much too large $20 bill under her bed because that’s all I had,” Kimmel shared. “We had to explain, ‘Oh, it’s the first tooth. Don’t expect $20 every time.'” If her personality now is any indication, we’d bet she’s going to grow up with plenty of her parent’s wit!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfn7auudhmoqKlnZq5brfInapo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./designer-elena-velez-outfit-taylor-swift-ttpd-fortnight-interview.html><span>←</span><span>Elena Velez on Dressing Taylor Swift for &amp;quot;Fortnight&amp;quot;</span></a>
