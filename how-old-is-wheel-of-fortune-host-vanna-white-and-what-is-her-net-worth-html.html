So how old is Vanna White and what is her net worth after more than 30 years in show business?</p><h2>Vanna White is 61 years old</h2><p id=par-4_55>We know it’s impolite to tell a lady’s age, but we would be ecstatic to look like Ms. White in our sixties. The former actress and South Carolina native was born on&nbsp;February 18, 1957. Though she was born Vanna Marie Rosich — she took the name of her stepfather&nbsp;Herbert Stackley White Jr. who raised her.</p><p id=par-5_104>Over the years, White has taken special care of her appearance, and she’s worn nearly 7,000 outfits on Wheel of Fortune — never wearing the same outfit twice. Though she doesn’t get to keep her dresses, <a href=#>in a 2016 interview with Fox News</a> — White explained that each week she tries on&nbsp;tries on 50 to 60 dresses and chooses her favorites. She revealed, “My favorite dresses happen to be the comfortable ones. They have to go back to the designer, but I certainly enjoy wearing them. I’ve gone through all the big styles, [including] the big shoulder pads. You name it; I’ve done it.”</p><p id=par-6_1>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HahALvfKLVk</p><h2>Vanna White is worth $50 million</h2><p id=par-7_79>It truly pays to be a game show host, and there is much more to White’s job then simply touching letters. She and Pat Sajak have helped come up with many&nbsp;puzzles over the years. <a href=#>Wheel of Fortune</a> executive producer&nbsp;<a href=#>Harry Friedman explained that it’s all</a>, “very scientific.” He added that&nbsp; everyone contributes to the “group effort.” For her efforts, White is paid a $10 million salary for Wheel of Fortune which has greatly contributed to her $50 million net worth.</p><p id=par-8_55>While it looks like she and Sajak have hardly anytime off, you should know that the Wheel of Fortune hosts tape a week’s worth of episodes in just one day. An avid fan of&nbsp;crochet and knitting– White also has her own brand of yarn, “Vanna’s Choice” through Lion Brand Yarns and a best-selling autobiography&nbsp;1987’s&nbsp;Vanna Speaks!</p><p id=par-10_42>Throughout the&nbsp;years, White has guest starred on various TV shows including&nbsp;L.A. Law,&nbsp;227,&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Queens, and&nbsp;Full House. She’s also lent her voice to the animated shows and specials&nbsp;—The Real Story of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star&nbsp;and the TV series&nbsp;Captain Planet and the Planeteers.</p><p id=par-11_13>Currently, White has signed on to remain on Wheel of Fortune until 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1sMOMqKOdZZmoeri0xJ6jZqeWYrOwvtOupZ5lmKTAtXnVmqWnmV2starAxGaYp5xdrLWiwIyiqmaglad6r7HTZq6oqqSde6nAzKVm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./willem-dafoe-matt-dillon-roll-handlebar-moustaches-film-new-action-flick-whiskey-bay-html.html><span>←</span><span>Willem Dafoe and Matt Dillon roll out the handlebar moustaches to film new action flick Whiskey Bay</span></a>
