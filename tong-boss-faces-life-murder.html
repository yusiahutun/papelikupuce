The court heard that Wong, who is thought to have left Hong Kong in the 1970s, established working links with the Sun Yee On in the mid-1980s, when he was already Tung On chairman.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He brought triad enforcers from Hong Kong to manage and provide security for an illegal gambling house.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, an internal dispute erupted between Sun Yee On members, and one faction turned to Wong for help.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1987, prosecutors said, Lam helped organise an operation in which two men working for him and Wong posed as passengers in a limousine service operated by the rival faction.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The men ordered the car to a remote area of Brooklyn, where they shot two of their rivals in the head from the back seat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The jury acquitted Wong of involvement in the killings, but convicted Lam.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, Wong was convicted of murder and conspiracy in connection with ordering an attack on members of the Ghost Shadows gang, which had encroached on Tung On turf.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the 1992 attack, three hooded men entered a Greenwich Village pool hall and fired more than 15 shots at a crowd of Chinese teenagers, killing a 17-year-old high school student, James Rou, and wounding four others.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">None of the victims was connected with the gangs, but it was the gunmen's co-operation with the authorities that led to Wong's arrest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdhZYB6fJdoq6iml2KvsL%2FSZp2am5Woeq21xZ5kpq2imbKz</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-black-friday-deals-under-25-2023-8399047.html><span>←</span><span>The 25 Best Extended Black Friday Deals Under $25 Up to 82% Off</span></a>
