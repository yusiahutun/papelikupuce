It’s like, “Oh, I’m going on vacation, I want to wear this perfect dress,” Nadia says, which made the store a perfect fit to clothe the White Lotus’s horny opulence.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Harper (Aubrey Plaza) wearing 1980s Plein Sud pants from Los Féliz.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>HBO</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Costume designer Alex Bovaird has said <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>she uses Instagram tags</a> to research what guests and locals are wearing when planning Mike White’s vacation-core show. To help pull pieces for filming in Sicily, Bovaird sent Nadia mood boards and references explaining each character’s style.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Much of season two’s swimwear hails from Los Féliz — including the Black Loewe swimsuit that Harper (Aubrey Plaza) wears. In it, she delivers the casually damning line, “I don’t watch Ted Lasso.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With its gold hardware and body-hugging lines, the suit sent Redditors Google searching and commerce editors pitching a wave of “where to shop” articles, but you won’t find the original. Once it returned from set (most pieces are rented), Nadia put it back up for sale.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Now I regret it. I was like ‘where is it?’” Does Nadia think the buyer knows what they have? “Probably not.”<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>A Loewe black swimsuit from Los Féliz, worn by Harper on White Lotus.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The hero’s share of the store’s vintage is worn by Harper, whose style Bovaird has said <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>was inspired by Audrey Hepburn</a>.</p><p>“I think Harper was the character who I liked the most or could have more empathy toward. I’m glad it was not Portia,” Nadia admits, laughing. “I didn’t love her outfits. I know it’s on purpose and I think it’s actually a very well-made character and actually very realistic, but I’m glad it was for Harper mostly or Daphne or Mia.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>A silk Lolita Lempicka dress worn by Harper on White Lotus.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While it looks like it could have been from “some Insta brand” (not derogatory), the pink silk dress that Harper wears to the final hotel dinner, Nadia notes, is actually vintage Lolita Lempicka from the store. When I point out how modern-looking it was, Nadia responds that good vintage “has the essence of what is being made constantly.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The starfish earrings on Mia (Beatrice Grannò) in episode two (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>pictured here</a>) are also from the store. Made by an Italian brand in the ‘90s, they’re equal parts whimsical and sculptural, playful but elegant — styles all signature to Los Féliz. “Anything with a starfish or shell — never fails.”&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Pink Dior swimsuit and starfish earrings, later worn by Mia (Beatrice Granno) on White Lotus.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Much of Daphne’s wardrobe resembles a Net-A-Porter haul, but the one-piece swimsuit she wears (also in episode two)&nbsp; featuring a playful cow-in-a-tub illustration is vintage Moschino that Nadia had both in yellow and white.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“In the streets, I see the tourists that really dress and are like her in a nice hotel," she says of Daphne. "She seems very realistic.”&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Daphne (Meghann Fahy) wearing a Moschino from Los Féliz.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>HBO</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Born on the Spanish island Majorca, Nadia moved to Barcelona for college and caught the vintage bug. “In Majora, we didn’t really have flea markets, so I started going here to one and I just got super addicted. I would go almost every day to the flea market.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nadia started organizing flea markets herself, renting out stalls for ten euros to friends. From there, she graduated to having her own “little corner” in a local store and nine years ago, launching a Big Cartel shop.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It took me months and months to sell something online. It was like the ‘Nasty Gal Era.’ It was just normal physical stores that had vintage,” Nadia says. “Online? I didn’t even know that was a thing.”&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Mia wearing a vintage Dior swimsuit from Los Féliz.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>HBO</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I found the store online through its collaborations with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Gil Rodriquez</a>, a slow-fashioned brand also followed by all of my Instagram crushes. Most of Nadia’s clientele are American. She's currently planning to bring her Mediterranean wares to the states twice this year, including, potentially, her first New York City pop-up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s going to be mobbed,” I tell her at the end of our call.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Is It? [laughs] I hope so.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Follow them now to get ahead of the line.&nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6qrWWnnba1sYylpq2to2K8tsDFoqusZZanvK551aKlrZmXmnq0tM6pZKWnqmKzprjIs2RwaGlrf3qD</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pokemon-go-egg-widget-not-showing-how-many-eggs-are-placed-in-an-incubator.html><span>←</span><span>Pokmon GO Egg Widget Not Showing How Many Eggs are Placed in an Incubator</span></a>
