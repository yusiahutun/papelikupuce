Everything he says seems to be taken into consideration by many people specialising in this field. That is why his latest statements on artificial intelligence, a technology that has burst onto the scene with great force and promises to change things as we know them, have been particularly striking.</p><p>Gates is clear on the latter, predicting a near future dominated by AI, although he believes there will be a few jobs that will 'survive' this kind of <a href=#><strong>technology</strong></a>. At least, that is what he has commented in the latest entry in his blog 'Gates Notes', where in recent months he has published several entries dedicated exclusively to artificial intelligence tools, analysing their virtues and also their possible risks.</p><p>In fact, one of these risks is precisely that artificial intelligence will end up replacing humans in many jobs, which would lead to the destruction of jobs, something that the International Monetary Forum has already predicted, stating that by 2025, 60% of jobs will be affected in some way by AI.</p><figure class="ue-c-article__media ue-c-article__media--video" readability=1><p><span class=ue-c-article__media-description>This is what Augmented Reality looks like in neurosurgery!</span><span class=ue-c-article__media-author><span>Roberto Ortega</span></span></p></figure><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>The three "immune" jobs for Bill Gates</h2><p>The Windows co-founder is clear that artificial intelligence tools will allow many jobs and processes to be automated, but he is not particularly pessimistic about how such tools can affect people, believing that they will actually help in many areas.</p><p>However, he does argue that in the near future there will only be three jobs that will be "immune" to AI, stating that the only ones that will 'resist' this new wave of technology will be energy-related jobs, biology-related positions and all those professionals who specialise in the design and operation of the AI tools themselves. The entrepreneur believes that, by the nature of the three areas, they will be the only ones where humans will not be replaceable.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jq2cnKCepLmws9hoaWlqZGR9dXuQamZvbmFtf3ewlJyYbW9kZoBxfZBxmW1tZ257qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nathan-mackinnon.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Nathan MacKinnon net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
