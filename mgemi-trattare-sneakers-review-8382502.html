Honestly, I’d rather drop a few hundred dollars on a pair of comfortable tennis shoes that I can get a lot of wear out of than a pair of sexy-but-painful heeled boots or narrow, pointy-toed flats that have me counting down the minutes until I can take them off. Over the years I have invested in a few pairs of expensive kicks from brands like Golden Goose, Alo Yoga, and even Gucci. Recently, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>comfy Italian shoe brand</a> that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Gigi Hadid wears</a>, M.Gemi, dropped <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">an eye-grabbing new style</a>, and I can report the elevated streetwear sneaker is just as elegant and chic as its name sounds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">The Trattare</a>, a low-top sneaker, comes in three color combinations, all-white, white and blue bell, and white and silver. I immediately gravitated towards the metallic style and appreciated the ultra-sophisticated, mixed-media feel of it. It features lots of textures, including Italian calf leather, suede, and technical fabrics — it even boasts silver laces (which can be swapped out). The sneaker is available in European whole and half sizes 35 to 41. I usually wear a 9.5 so I ordered a 40.5.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>M.GEMI</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like Golden Goose, M.Gemi’s shoes — including the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>coveted dad sneaker it dropped in the spring</a> — are handmade in Italy using premium Italian leather. Once I took <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">The Trattare</a> out of the box, I immediately noticed how well-made and high-quality it was. The craftsmanship is next level; the shoe feels substantial, much more so than a pair of $180 Nikes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Comfort is always a bonus, of course, and this style does not disappoint. The first time I wore them, I spent hours walking around the city and there were no complaints from my feet, which were supported and cushioned to perfection. Additionally, my feet didn’t sweat, courtesy of the tactful perforation. I also appreciated the little lift from the platform, which offers an elongating and slimming effect.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>M.GEMI</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Looks-wise the style is clearly inspired by a court shoe with a lightweight, 1.6-inch platform recycled rubber sole and round toe. One thing I love about a fine pair of sneakers, especially this pair, is that they have the ability to immediately elevate an otherwise simple outfit. For example, pair these with something as simple as leggings and a tank and you have immediately upgraded your look from athletic to ath-luxury.&nbsp; So far I have worn mine with everything from a tennis skirt and a sundress to jeans and sweats and have found the shoe to be truly versatile. If you are wanting something a little more casual, opt for the all-white or white and blue version. Personally, silver does it for me.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for the price, compared to Golden Goose, which retail for $545 and up, the Trattare is a bargain at $298. The TL;DR? <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">The Trattare</a> is already selling out in select color and size combinations, so I suggest ordering a pair ASAP to avoid missing out.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>M.GEMI</p></span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zKCcpqFdqb%2BiwNOaqZ5lo6OyorfEq6pmqpWrtqbDjHFqcWplZX8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./underwear-lingerie-and-shapewear.html><span>←</span><span>Here's How to Properly Wash Period Underwear, According to a Laundry Expert</span></a>
