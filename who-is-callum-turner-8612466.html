According to gossip account Deux Moi, the pair were first spotted "looking cozy" after <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the 2024 Golden Globes</a> in January, and from that point on, it's been a whirlwind of speculation and sleuthing.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s new, but they’re mad about each other,” a source previously told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Page Six</a> about their relationship, adding that Lipa even attended the Masters of Air premiere to "support" Turner. He returned the favor and accompanied Lipa to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>the 2024 BAFTAs</a> (though they walked the red carpet separately), as well as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>the Grammys</a>. And while the couple are playing coy for now, it's only a matter of time before they start gushing about each other in the press.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But, in the meantime, here's everything we know about Dua Lipa's new boyfriend and their budding relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-long-have-dua-lipa-and-callum-turner-been-dating></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How long have Dua Lipa and Callum Turner been dating?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's difficult to pinpoint exactly when Lipa and Turner struck up their romance, but dating rumors began to swirl at the beginning of January, after they were spotted looking very much like a couple at a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Golden Globes after-party</a>. For context, Lipa broke off her fling with Romain Gavras in early December, so she and Turner likely met sometime in between.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Deux Moi was the first to report the news with an anonymous tip, before a source at Page Six confirmed they were in a relationship a few days later.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-did-dua-lipa-and-callum-turner-debut-their-relationship></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How did Dua Lipa and Callum Turner debut their relationship?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Very casually. Lipa and Turner hard-launched their relationship with a paparazzi walk in Los Angeles following their dinner date at West Hollywood's Sushi Park, holding hands and looking very into each other <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>(see photos here)</a>. For the occasion, Lipa wore a pair of Alaïa mesh flats with stone-wash denim and a white tank top with a black trim, while Turner opted for jeans and a cream-colored pullover with white sneakers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They looked over the moon," an eyewitness told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Entertainment Tonight</a> at the time. "It was like they were glued together. He looked smitten and she was just super, super happy. They're a really cute couple."&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-have-dua-lipa-and-callum-turner-attended-any-red-carpet-events-together></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Have Dua Lipa and Callum Turner attended any red carpet events together?&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Technically, yes, although, they haven't walked the actual red carpet together as of yet. First, Lipa and Turner both attended the Masters of Air premiere in Los Angeles, where they were spotted on video <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>slow-dancing and kissing</a> at the after-party. Next, they showed up separately to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>2024 BAFTAs</a>, but, again, they linked up at the after-party; the same situation occurred at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>the Grammys</a> a few weeks earlier.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-does-callum-turner-do-for-a-living></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What does Callum Turner do for a living?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Turner is an actor, who is best known for his roles in Fantastic Beasts, The Boys in the Boat, and the TV miniseries War & Peace. He first starred in&nbsp;Think of England,&nbsp;a short student film for the University of Hertfordshire Film and Television Programme made in 2010, and a decade later, he was nominated for Best Actor at the BAFTAs for playing Lance Corporal in the mystery series The Capture. He recently starred as Major John Egan in the Apple TV+ series Masters of the Air alongside Austin Butler and Barry Keoghan.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-where-is-callum-turner-from></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Where is Callum Turner from?&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Turner is from London. He was born in Hammersmith, but was raised as an only child in a working-class neighborhood in Chelsea by a single mother, Rosemary Turner, whom Lipa has already met. Back in February, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Daily Mail</a> shared photos of the trio saying their goodbyes outside and Rosemary and the "Houdini" singer sharing a hug.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-does-callum-turner-have-an-instagram-account></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Does Callum Turner have an Instagram account?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Surprisingly, he does not. Turner previously told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Independent </a>that he tries “not to play with fame that much, so it doesn’t then play with me," adding, “I don’t go to events and I don’t have Instagram. I have a pretty low-key life and I enjoy that, but also I love acting."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK571qGmZqGjYrCiuMuupGaspae7pr6McW1qamRrgw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./schoolgirl-13-lost-leg-shark-attack-whitsundays-makes-incredible-recovery-html.html><span>←</span><span>Schoolgirl, 13, who lost her leg in a shark attack in the Whitsundays makes an incredible recovery</span></a>
