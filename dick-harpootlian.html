He has been serving as a member of the South Carolina Senate from the 20th district since 2013 and, prior to that, held several prominent positions within the state’s Democratic Party.</p><p>From 1998 to 2003, he was elected chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party before being re-elected in 2011 for another two-year term until 2013.
