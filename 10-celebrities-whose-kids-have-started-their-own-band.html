Instead of acting or modeling, these celeb offspring opt to go a little more rock 'n' roll and start their own band. Stars like Kate Hudson and Jude Law all have children that found their calling on stage. And whether they're singing, drumming or playing the guitar, these kids have no problem proving that creative talent clearly runs in the family.</p><p>Find out whose kids are rocking out…</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9c09a3bc-da1d-487d-a541-e0da3ca8f295 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0a8e3eac-1475-44ec-b679-32545d8f6289 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/31/5by4/2022/07/22/31736567238d4e7082dd9e850948f736_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">11 of the Longest Lasting Celebrity Friendships in Hollywood</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>1. </strong><a href=#><strong>Kate Hudson</strong></a><strong> & Chris Robinson</strong></p><p>Kate Hudson and Chris Robinson's son Ryder Robinson is following in the footsteps of his musician father. Ryder now has his own band called Codependence which recently played a show at The Mint in Los Angeles. Both Kate and Ryder's famous grandfather Kurt Russell were in attendance for the band's big night. Kate even <a href=#>shared photos</a> from the show, jokingly calling herself a "stage mom." The band has yet to release music but appears to have plans to continue playing shows around Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>2. </strong><a href=#><strong>Pamela Anderson</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Tommy Lee</strong></a></p><p>Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee's son Dylan Jagger Lee prefers to keep his music career low-key. He and collaborator Anton Khabbaz have released music under the name Motel 7 but kept their identities secret for quite some time. In fact, Tommy says he didn't even know Dylan was in a band until the duo officially revealed their identities online.</p><p>"I didn't tell my parents or anything, I try to keep them as far out of it as possible. He was pretty pissed when he figured it out. He was, like, 'Dude, what the f---? You didn't tell me you were singing and s---, that's so dope. What the f---?' And then I was, like, 'Yeah, I'm pretty low key,'" Dylan told <a href=#>WWD</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0c6a6977-ac33-4664-8126-040808ca4ff7 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0a8e3eac-1475-44ec-b679-32545d8f6289 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/af/5by4/2020/05/18/afc95b2301d64b85b4aab6024937f06e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">25 Celebrities Who Decided to Change Their Name</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>3. </strong><a href=#><strong>Pierce Brosnan</strong></a></p><p>Pierce Brosnan and his ex Keely Shaye Smith are parents to Dylan Brosnan -- a model and aspiring musician. As a teenager, Dylan started his band Raspberry Blonde and went on to release several songs. Pierce even gave the group a <a href=#>shoutout on social media</a>. While it's been a while since the band has released new music, Dylan still has the music linked in the bio of his Instagram account -- leading some fans to believe that more is on the way.</p><p><strong>4. </strong><a href=#><strong>Billie Joe Armstrong</strong></a></p><p>It’s hard to avoid the rock 'n' roll lifestyle when your dad is Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong. The musician's son Joey Armstrong has started his own music career, playing with his band SWMRS since 2004 -- although the band has had a few name changes along the way. As the group was just kids when they formed, they didn't release their debut album until 2011 and their first release under their current name didn't come until 2016. Since then, they signed a record deal, released another album and toured around the world.</p><p>The band is currently on a hiatus following sexual misconduct allegations against Joey.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b36feac0-cb44-4fe1-919f-042cd0f8fe0e data-container-ref=toofab:article:0a8e3eac-1475-44ec-b679-32545d8f6289 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/bb/5by4/2022/05/13/bb97fb25e93a46d5996ea49d75a7ae4e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">20 Celebrity Kids Who Have Dated Each Other</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>5. </strong><a href=#><strong>Bob Dylan</strong></a></p><p>Bob Dylan's son Jakob Dylan may no longer be a kid but when he was just 20, he started his band The Wallflowers. The band went on to win multiple Grammys and sell millions of albums through the years, which Bob says makes him incredibly proud.</p><p>"I'm proud of his accomplishments…I worried about him when he started out. I just didn't want to see him get roughed up. This business can really throw you into deep water. He's had his ups and downs…He and his band have done rather well. In the contemporary music scene, they have got a voice to be heard," Bob <a href=#>reportedly</a> said at the peak of the band’s fame.</p><p><strong>6. </strong><a href=#><strong>Jude Law</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Sadie Frost</strong></a></p><p>Jude Law and Sadie Frost's son Rafferty Law started his band Outer Stella Overdrive back in 2018. He teamed up with bandmate Rudy Albarn, who also has some famous family as the nephew of Blur's Damon Albarn. The group spent the pandemic working on music and eventually released their debut album "Clout & Self Doubt" in 2021. While the band is still together, Rafferty announced his departure in 2022.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:bdc30f7e-2e6f-4821-b66d-5bf9058a1762 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0a8e3eac-1475-44ec-b679-32545d8f6289 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/97/5by4/2021/08/12/97b7a7283f2c44a2a229bfd2632e6591_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">13 Actors Who Were Injured in the Middle of Filming</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>7. </strong><a href=#><strong>Andie MacDowel</strong></a><strong>l & Paul Qualley</strong></p><p>In 2016, Andie MacDowell and Paul Qualley's daughter Rainey Qualley began releasing music under the name Rainsford -- her full first name. She released her EP "Emotional Support Animal" in 2018 and has since dropped several other singles and appeared on other artists' releases. In addition to music, she's also pursued both acting and modeling and she says she is proud to be able to do it all.</p><p>"I've been able to pursue both simultaneously and it's nice to have a bit of separation from who I am as a musical artist and who I am as an actor. Having a separate name as an artist makes it feel more like a special project," Rainey told <a href=#>As If magazine</a>.</p><p><strong>8. </strong><a href=#><strong>Bob Marley</strong></a></p><p>Bob Marley's eldest son Ziggy Marley was the leader of his family's band, Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers, beginning when he was just a preteen in 1979. The group included his siblings Sharon, Cedella and Stephen and they ended up releasing over 15 albums that earned them numerous Grammys. The group continued until 2002 when the group decided to pursue other endeavors.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f54d1d34-9ad4-4b00-aa67-8221027ad686 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0a8e3eac-1475-44ec-b679-32545d8f6289 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/93/5by4/2022/08/05/93f0ff4dedc24ee7b628fe8d07805ba4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">11 Celebs Who Almost Went Broke Before Making It Big</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>9.

The album propelled them to fame and earned them five Grammy nominations. They released one more album before going their separate ways just a few years later.
