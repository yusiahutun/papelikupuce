They later parted ways, and Ricci moved on to Mark Hampton, who she claims greatly influenced her kids.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep reading to know more about Freddie Heerdegen and his relationship with his mother.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Freddie_Heerdegen></span>Who Is Freddie Heerdegen?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Freddie Heerdegen is Christina Ricci’s first child and son.&nbsp;The talented actress welcomed Freddie with her then-husband James Heerdegen but initially kept news of their child out of the media.&nbsp;</p><p>Ricci was not in a hurry to reveal news of her pregnancy, but she sparked pregnancy rumors after she was pictured at LAX Airport sporting a visible baby bump in 2015. Despite her best wishes, news of her delivery quickly spread, and shortly after, her spokesperson confirmed she was expecting.</p><p>Two months later, in August of the same year, she welcomed her son. She and James were elated about welcoming a child, and a source revealed they were ready for the journey ahead. Freddie’s arrival overjoyed Ricci. After she and James married, she admitted to loving building a family with him.&nbsp;</p><p>She <a href=#>said</a>: “He’s my favorite person on Earth. I can’t wait to have our little world replete with small beings!” Ricci opted to keep her son’s name a secret for six years until she revealed it in an interview with an E! Host named Brad Goreski.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Christina_Ricci_Married></span>Is Christina Ricci Married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, Christina Ricci is currently married. Her first husband was James Heerdegen, but after their divorce, she got married to Mark Hampton. The couple are still together and have welcomed a child of their own named Cleopatra.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hamp-fotor-20230704143442-645x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Freddie_Heerdegen_Age></span>Freddie Heerdegen Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ricci’s first son is currently eight years old, born in 2014.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Freddie_Heerdegen_Net_worth></span>Freddie Heerdegen Net worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He is still a child, so his worth is not yet up for discussion. It is believed, however, that Freddie lives in splendor thanks to his parent’s riches.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_Does_Freddie_Heerdegen_Still_Sleep_With_Christina_Ricci></span>Why Does Freddie Heerdegen Still Sleep With Christina Ricci?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In September 2022, Christina Ricci revealed that her eight-year-old son sleeps in her bed while her much younger daughter sleeps in her crib.</p><p>She <a href=#>said</a>: “The fact that I can put her down in her crib, and she just goes to sleep when my 8-year-old still sleeps with me is amazing.”&nbsp;</p><p>According to the “Yellowjackets” actress, she attempted to sleep-train Freddie when he was much younger, but he hated sleeping in his crib and would often protest.&nbsp;Ricci could not ignore his cries as she felt uncomfortable letting him cry it out.</p><p>She said: “He screamed himself hoarse and started banging his head against the crib railing.”&nbsp;That ended when he started sleeping in her bed. Fortunately for Ricci and her husband, Mark Hampton, their daughter Cleo does not mind the alone time.</p><p>She explained: “But with Cleo when we decided to try it and see how she would react to it, she just sort of whined for about seven minutes and then laid down, clutched her little unicorn, and went to sleep.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ric.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Freddie_Heerdegen_Is_Being_Raised_as_a_Feminist></span>Freddie Heerdegen Is Being Raised as a Feminist<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ricci admitted in December 2022 that her work as an actress is already impacting her son, Freddie. In an interview with The Guardian, she said Freddie “won’t be able to avoid” adopting a feminist perspective because of teachings from her and his stepdad.</p><p>She <a href=#>said</a>: “My husband, Mark [Hampton], is, I hate to say it because it sounds obnoxious, a feminist, and Freddie will see that and see his working mother.” Ricci added, “I think he’ll see women in a much more layered, complicated way just by having grown up watching his mom do all this stuff.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Freddie_Heerdegen_Parents></span>Freddie Heerdegen Parents&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Freedie was born to Christina Ricci and James Heerdegen. Ricci and James first met in 2011 while working on ABC’s series “Pan Am.” They dated for two years before tying the knot and welcoming their son a year later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jamess-fotor-20230704143732-1024x1024.jpg><p>Their marriage crashed in June 2020 after Ricci filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. Subsequently, the pair got into a bitter battle, accusing each other of abuse and recklessness.</p><p>Ricci claimed that James got violent with her in 2019 when they traveled to New Zealand. She went as far as accusing James of abusing her physically and emotionally. She also stated that she was scared for her life because of what James would tell her.&nbsp;</p><p>During one of his violent episodes, Ricci alleged that she attempted to call 911, but her former husband chased her around the house to stop her. After filing for divorce, she requested a restraining order against James, which was granted.&nbsp;</p><p>James also accused her of several things, including how she abused alcohol and prescription drugs. His claims were dismissed, and some months later, the pair reached a custody arrangement.&nbsp;</p><p>James and Ricci are not the first Hollywood couple to experience violence within their relationship. Others like them include Chris Brown and Rihanna, actor-turned-murderer <a href=#>Michael Jace</a> and his late wife.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZp6imrGltcRmn56dopmyqLHNZpinnF2stbp5w6icrGWYmnq0wMilo2arnJqysXnWoquhZZiewG65zq2fnqpf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shannon-de-lima-wiki-son-net-worth-height-age-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Shannon De Lima Wiki, Son, Net Worth, Height, Age, Biography</span></a>
