<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Holidaymakers stunned at 88p price of beer in European city dubbed 'Blackpool with sun'</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>A bloke living in the sun-trapped Spanish coastal city of Benidorm has left people feeling jealous after revealing its cheap drink prices in a video – people are shocked at the low prices he showed off.</p><p>Dazza, who posts all about his numerous holidays in Spain on social media, gave his viewers a quick price check while having a stroll along the promenade in Benidorm. In his video, he stops by the row of cafes and bars and shows the drink list on the board.</p><p>"Look at these prices - cheap!" he said. Most of the drinks on offer are less than €5 (£4.40) – with coffees and teas priced at €1 (88p)each. Any local brandy, Baileys or Tia Maria was shown to cost just €1.60 (£1.40) each in 2023.</p><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>READ MORE: Spain warning as partying tourists in Majorca and Ibiza could face £25,000 fines</a></b></p><p><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow><b>READ MORE: Brit holidaymakers in Costa del Sol told 'f*** off' in anti-tourist campaign</b></a></p><p>In the video shared last year, Dazza showed his viewers the cheap prices emblazoned across blackboards and signs in Benidorm. The bar next door offered €1 beer every day until 7pm, including a pint of Amstel or Fosters. Bottled beers cost either €1 or €1.50 (88p or £1.32). While in another video, Dazza showed a board of "happy hour shots" with almost all double shots priced at €2 (£1.76) only.</p><p>Viewers were stunned to see the bargain booze considering the cost of drinks in the UK has skyrocketed in recent years. According to PintPrice, the cost of a pint in London is now a hefty £4 on average while in Edinburgh it's £3.78. That seems not to be the case in Benidorm as Dazza's pal Grummet recently confirmed how much he had spent on a recent holiday.</p><p>He recently told Daily Star of his latest bargain deal. He said: "I went to Benidorm for a week and flight plus accommodation was £107." He added: "Pints are 84p in some bars, food is cheap and the full holiday cost £253. I’d spend that going out on a Friday and Saturday in the UK!" His flight was just £37 for a return and Skyscanner claims you can bag them as cheap as £31.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29449780.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_vlcsnap-2023-03-13-17h26m19s344.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29449781.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_vlcsnap-2023-03-13-17h26m05s950.jpg><p>According to PintPrice, the average cost of a pint in the town is a tiny 90p – and it's not just pints at the local bars that are cheap either. Apparently you can bag a Full English breakfast for just £2 over in Benidorm town. There's nothing quite as relaxing as scarfing down a top breakfast while the sun shines and you know you can take a nap to get through your food coma. One said: "Everyone's dressed from Sports Direct."</p><p>In the comments of Dazza's video, Brits commented on the cheap prices. "Look at the prices and look at the clientele," one said and a third commented: "We are ripped off in this country! People paying £7 for a pint in England and freezing."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29449782.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_British-Tourists-In-Benidorm-Pay-Tribute-To-Queen-Elizabeth-II.jpg><p>But others were not too keen about the area, with a person saying: "The type of destination I avoid like the plague...Blackpool in the Sun." Another added: "But you're in Benidorm, I'd rather go to Pyongyang."</p><p>"Great place Benidorm, something for everyone, old town, tapas alley, nightlife for all and a great vibe, but not for everyone," a second added. Dazza replied to the negative comments and said Benidorm is "nothing like it", as he referred to a comment about the place as "the warm version of Blackpool".</p><p><b id=docs-internal-guid-434084f5-7fff-42f5-3c5c-082569b44bdd><i>Check out </i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i><u>more of the Daily Star’s latest travel stories</u></i></a><i> by signing up to our free weekly newsletter.</i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKyilsOmuI6tqZqulaF6r7HWrGahp5yesaLFzJqinqqjYsC1wc2nnJ1laG29brzRopqeZZKasrN5kXJrbXFjbn4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-mackay-girlfriend-family-height-html.html><span>←</span><span>George MacKay Dating, Gay, Family, 2019</span></a>
