It deep cleanses the scalp, gets rid of residue build-up from other hair products, and leaves the hair clean, refreshed, and revitalized. However, it’s important to note that not all shampoos are created equal. Choosing the best clarifying shampoo for your hair type requires careful consideration.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Understand Your Hair Type</strong></p><p>First and foremost, you must identify your hair type to make an informed decision about the kind of clarifying shampoo that suits your natural hair. The range of natural hair types can vary from loose waves to tight curls, and each type requires different kinds of care and products. For example, if you have a curly hair type that tends to dry out, look for a clarifying shampoo that will provide intense hydration along with cleaning the scalp and hair.</p><p><strong>2. Check the Ingredients</strong></p><p>After you have understood your hair type, it’s time to look at the shampoo ingredients. For natural hair, avoid products that contain sulfates, as these chemicals can strip the hair of its natural oils leading to dryness and breakage. On the other hand, look for natural ingredients like aloe vera, tea tree oil, or jojoba oil which cleanse and hydrate the hair without causing harm. Also, ingredients like shea butter or glycerin can provide extra moisturizing properties, essential for hair that tends to be dry.</p><p><strong>3. Consider the pH Balance&nbsp;</strong></p><p>When shopping for a clarifying shampoo for your natural hair, remember to consider the pH balance. An ideal shampoo should have a pH level close to that of human hair, which is slightly acidic (around 4.5-5.5). Such products help maintain the health of your hair and scalp by preserving their natural oils. They can also aid in preventing the hair cuticle from lifting, reducing frizz, and retaining moisture in your hair strands.</p><p><strong>4. Think About Your Hair’s Porosity</strong></p><p>Another important factor to consider while choosing the best clarifying shampoo for natural hair is its porosity. Hair porosity refers to your hair's ability to absorb and retain moisture. If you have <a href=#><u>high porosity hair</u></a>, which tends to lose moisture easily, opt for a product with deep moisturizing properties. Alternatively, low-porosity hair doesn't absorb moisture easily, so you would need a product that helps open up your hair cuticles for better absorption.</p><p><strong>5. Consider Your Scalp Health</strong></p><p>Lastly, the health of your scalp plays a crucial role in your shampoo selection process. If you have a dry scalp, opt for a clarifying shampoo that not only cleanses but also moisturizes.</p><p>Speaking of the uses of a clarifying shampoo, our contributor Dr. Hamdan Abdullah Hamed, a certified dermatologist, says, “A clarifying shampoo is used for flaky scalp because it can remove excess oil and dirt. It is one way to help remove dandruff and itchiness because it removes dead skin cells as well as cleans the pores without getting rid of the natural oils.”</p><p>On the other hand, if you have an oily scalp, look for a product that thoroughly cleanses without leaving behind any residue. Remember, a healthy scalp contributes to healthier and shinier natural hair. Therefore, it’s vital to choose a product that promotes your overall scalp health.</p><p><strong>Contributor:&nbsp;</strong>Dr. Hamdan, Dermatologist - <a href=#>PowerYourCurls</a></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The best clarifying shampoo for natural hair is one that effectively removes product buildup, excess oil, and impurities without stripping the hair of its natural moisture. A top-rated deep cleansing shampoo also provides nourishment and hydration to the hair while promoting its natural shine and volume. Aunt Jackie's Curls and Coils Oh So Clean Deep and Nothing But Tea Tree Oil Clarifying Shampoo are among our favorites from the list. Ultimately, the best clarifying shampoo is subjective and will depend on your hair type, needs, and personal preference. It is advisable to do a patch test or consult a hair professional before trying out a new product.</p><h2 class=title>Why Trust Pinkvilla</h2><p>Alvira, the author is a budding journalist and a haircare expert.
