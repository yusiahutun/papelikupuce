The bullet penetrated through the limb and into his other leg, rendering him immobile.</p><p>They then sprayed him with acid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19852141.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/120432><p>Mrs Selby told the court: "He cried out, then it all went quiet and I raised my head to look around the bedroom. He was lying on the floor and one of the intruders was standing over him."</p><p>The court heard one of the gang also stormed into the bedroom of Mr Selby's daughter, Jade, and threw a liquid at her but it did not make contact. The gang then fled.</p><p>Paramedics arrived at the scene to find Mr Selby lying on the floor with acid burns to the back of his scalp, neck, back and legs.</p><p>He was taken to Leeds General Infirmary and then transferred to a specialist unit at Pinderfields Hospital, Wakefield, with 50% acid burns.</p><p>Mr Selby had two surgeries and initially there was an improvement in his condition – but he then deteriorated and sadly died.</p><p>Simon Myerson QC prosecuting said: "The manner of Mr Selby's death was shocking and upsetting. What these men had done is to shoot Barry Selby in the left leg. It was a kneecapping. They then doused his back from head to foot with acid.</p><p>"Police and paramedics who attended noticed a haze and a strong sulphurous smell and were themselves affected by the fumes.</p><p>"Mr Selby was covered in what looked like brown paint that paramedics correctly believed was acid. Unfortunately, without knowing the type of acid, the paramedics were unable to wash it away and just had to watch as it burned into Mr Selby's back.</p><p>"The flesh from his neck, back, arms and legs had been burned away. Mr Selby's system was simply unable to cope with the stress to which it was subjected, his heart and kidneys were affected and he died."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19852142.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/120435><p>Det Ch Insp Nick Wallen, of West Yorks Police, said after the case that officers had never seen the use of acid in such circumstances and with such "devastating consequences".</p><p>He said: "Barry was a much loved husband, father and grandfather and is sadly missed by family and friends. The defendants have not given evidence and have never offered an explanation for what they did, but they are, without doubt, very dangerous and evil men.</p><p>"The lengthy sentences passed down today clearly reflect the seriousness of their actions and are welcomed by the team of police officers and staff who have worked on this investigation. I would also like to thank those who gave evidence for showing great courage in coming forward."</p><p>A statement from Mr Selby's family, said: "We are extremely happy with the outcome of the trial and the verdict has shown us that justice has been served. We would like to say thank you to our close family and friends for their support throughout what has been a traumatic time.</p><p>"We would also like to thank the police family liaison officers for the support they have provided over the past months.We now feel as a family that we have some closure and can start to move forward with our lives."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwuMCtnKysXaOyuL%2BOppynZZqWtq2xw2ajop6VYq6ktcNmmK2skZi4bn2XcGpvaWNm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-free-portable-alternative-to-windows-scheduled-tasks.html><span>←</span><span>A Free Portable Alternative To Windows Task Scheduler</span></a>
