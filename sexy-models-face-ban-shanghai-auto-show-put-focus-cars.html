If the ban goes ahead, it will be the toughest action the mainland's ideological authorities have taken so far in policing trade shows.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Car shows have gained notoriety in recent years after some organisers hired scantily clad - even nude - women to pose with their vehicles to draw visitors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hundreds of models were hired for the Shanghai Auto Show in previous years, attracting more than 800,000 visitors each time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shanghai and Beijing take turns to host the show each year.

"New cars flanked by stars or famous models attract more visitors."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Top movie stars or famous fashion models earned as much as 100,000 yuan (HK$126,000) for flanking the cars for just a few hours, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The potential ban on car models follows propaganda authorities' controversial censorship of television drama .
