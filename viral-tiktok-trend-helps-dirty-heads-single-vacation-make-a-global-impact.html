On 2/6/21, he sneezed into his arm, which phased into him performing the track onstage in front of&nbsp;thousands of fans at a concert in Florida.<p>The band originally wrote the song about paying tribute to those who love their jobs. For those that don’t, there’s still time to try something else. Life’s too short not to do something we’re passionate about. Released in 2017 as part of their sixth studio album, SWIM TEAM, the song was #1 on Billboard Hot Rock& was a top 10 hit on the Mediabase Alternative Airplay Chart. In 2018, they performed the track on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and released their own beer, Vacation Session Ale + Pineapple, partnering with Huntington Beach’s Four Sons Brewery. Now, with its resurgence, the song has skyrocketed to this organic viral moment, giving them new fans on different mediums, and increased streams across all platforms by 40 percent. This has significantly increased the band’s profile in International markets, earning the song introductions on over 25 viral international playlists, viral and pop playlists with massive global reach, 500 percent increase of Shazams, entry on the Shazam Global Top 200 Chart and TikTok daily, weekly, trending videos and all-time top track charts.&nbsp;</p>Watson commented on the trend, “We’re stoked people are drawing inspiration from the song and the message behind the lyrics. It was cool to see the trend grow organically and watch people enjoying life,&nbsp;whether it’s at work or on vacation. That’s what the track’s all about.” You can watch a newly released vertical video starting today of the band doing what they love, performing to thousands of fans, while integrating some of the above mentioned clips.
