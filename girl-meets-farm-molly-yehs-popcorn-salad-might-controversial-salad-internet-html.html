The ingredients? Sour cream, popcorn, vegetables, and mayonnaise. The internet erupted, causing the recipe to go viral thanks to its unusual ingredient list.&nbsp;Needless to say, <a href=#>reactions on social media varied</a>.</p><p id=par-3_53>Yeh’s not the first — and she probably won’t be the last — Food Network star to have a recipe go viral. In April 2020, a video of Barefoot Contessa host, <a href=#>Ina Garten, making a giant cocktail</a> went viral when the Modern Comfort Food author posted it as an April Fools’ Day joke.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-the-girl-meets-farm-popcorn-salad-has-mixed-reviews>The Girl Meets Farm popcorn salad has mixed reviews</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_47>Putting popcorn in a salad is bound to get different reactions from taste testers. At the time of publication, Yeh’s popcorn salad, which she described on Girls Meets Farm as a “riff on an iconic Midwestern dish,” has three out of five stars on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Food Network</a>’s website.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_46>“I had to try this recipe and it wasn’t terrible! But, I wouldn’t make it again with the popcorn,” one reviewer said. “The initial crunch and different textures are good, but I found I kept getting pieces of kernel stuck in my teeth, which was off-putting.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_34>They added another downside: “You also can’t keep the leftovers because it gets soggy. I will use this dressing recipe again, though! It’s got great flavor and would be great for a macaroni salad!”</p><p id=par-7_55>A different reviewer described the salad as “really tasty!” saying that “Popcorn is one of my favorite snacks and this surprisingly delicious recipe does not disappoint!” They also noted they “did take some creative liberties with the ingredients,” adding the “dressing to the popcorn at serving rather than blending the whole batch to avoid sogginess.”</p><p id=par-8_27>Someone else said they’d “definitely make this again” noting, “We loved the textures and colors of all the veggies and the tangy dressing brought everything together perfectly!”</p><p id=par-9_54>Others weren’t happy with the recipe. One reviewer wrote, “I love Molly but this is absolute NO!,” before referring to it as a “waste of good ingredients.” The reviewer also rejected Yeh’s claim about it being a Midwestern dish: “None of my friends or family heard of it before – I live in Wisconsin.”</p><h2 id=h-how-to-make-yeh-s-crunchy-snap-pea-popcorn-salad>How to make Yeh’s Crunchy Snap Pea Popcorn Salad</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=en dir=ltr>happy saturday, fronds! i’m going live today on @foodnetworkkitchen from my kitchen! tune in at 1pm/12c for cheesy pickles, 4pm/3c for meatless meatball sliders, and 6pm/5c for broccolini sausage pizza pockets! and because it’s gonna be LIVE who knowwwws… <a href=#>https://t.co/NoQ44ruW5r</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7HVPIZgwNy</a></p>— Molly Yeh (@mollyyeh) <a href=#>November 2, 2019</a></figure><p id=par-10_58>Here’s how to make Yeh’s viral popcorn salad.
