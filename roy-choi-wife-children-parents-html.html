As a teenager, Roy had problems with drugs. Although he recovered from drug addiction, his life struggles were far from over.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Firstly, he stumbled upon various paths before finding his calling in food. Then, when Roy finally started settling down in his professional life, he became jobless at 38.</p><p style=text-align:justify>As an unemployed middle-aged man, he was trying to make ends meet when his friend, Mark Manguera, called him with the&nbsp;Kogi BBQ truck&nbsp;idea. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>After the unique concept became popular, the food chef hasn’t looked back in his career.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Roy Choi’s Restaurants&nbsp;</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The chef has several restaurants across America. Apart from his signature Kogi BBQ in Los Angeles, he has restaurants, namely 3 Worlds Cafe, Alibi Room, Sunny Spot, A-Frame, Chego, and Pot at the Line Hotel in the city of dreams.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Apart from his home city, he has a restaurant named Best Friend in a high-profile resort in Las Vegas.

When the chef’s friend Mark called, he refused to jump into it.</p><p style=text-align:justify>But, even when he got on board with the idea of tacos filled with Korean barbecue, success didn’t happen in a day. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>The pair would take their food truck before bars across Los Angeles. While people used to love their food, it didn’t contribute much to their business growth as most bar customers would be drunk. And, the next day, they would forget about the food.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The turning point that came in Roy’s career began when a group of women from UCLA came to eat their food. He requested them to put it on Twitter, and the food truck became viral.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Roy and his team were all over social media and in newspapers.
