Even if you can’t afford the high-end stuff, surely you’d find something to wear to yoga class (sweatpants at Target are $9.99!)</p><p>But according to Schwarz, there’s another, deeper reason to eschew clothes during a session: The opportunity to really focus in and be one with your body and the world. According to the Bold & Naked Yoga website, naked yoga “frees you from negative feelings about your body and allows to to be more accepting and deeper connected with yourself and the world around you.” The site also states that&nbsp;“Being completely at ease in your naked body is the ultimate expression of self-confidence. If you are okay with being naked you’ll feel more comfortable in general and can take yourself anywhere in the world. That’s very powerful.”</p><h3><strong>MORE: <a title="Yikes!

Or contact between students? Touching of a sexual nature is not tolerated. “Sometimes teachers will incorporate partner work into their classes that involves touching and body contact between members,” says the site. “However, this is not to be ‘sexual touching’ and should any contact of sexual nature occur, it will not be tolerated and will result in the offending member being asked to leave.”</p><p>Schwarz, who is originally from Europe, is hoping to spread his liberal ideas about nudity to his American yoga audiences. “I hope they will realize how cool and freeing and liberating it can really be,” he said.</p><p>What do you think?
